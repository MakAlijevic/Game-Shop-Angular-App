        "description": "<p><em>Black Ops II</em> is the ninth main title in the <em>Call of Duty</em> first-person shooter franchise and the sequel to <a href=\"/search/?q=Call+of+Duty%3A+Black+Ops\">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a>. It is set primarily in the near future of 2025 with one third of the game also taking place in the late 1980s. The timelines and story are connected through the playable characters of Alex Mason and Frank Woods in the past, and David Mason — the son of Alex Mason — in the future timeline. The future missions also feature an aged Woods giving exposition for the 1980s backdrop and share the same villain, Raul Menendez, who's decades long vendetta is the primary focus of the single player campaign. The plot centers on a new cold war between China and The United States over REE (Rare Earth Elements) and its manipulation by Menendez. It has an emphasis on unmanned drones and other robotic technology — a first for the series. Another first for the series is the ability to customize multiplayer-style loadouts before each mission as well as a far less linear campaign. The player can now make choices throughout the storyline that can affect small aspects such as the appearance of NPCs all the way to major decisions that can change the ending entirely. There are new sandbox-style missions dubbed Strike Force. Playing similar to a real-time strategy game, these missions give the player the opportunity to command troops and drones from an overhead view but with the option to zoom into any one of the units, at which point the gameplay switches to standard first-person shooter controls and gameplay. Strike Force is implemented within the campaign and has repercussions on the storyline depending on how the player performs. </p>\n<p>Multiplayer comes with familiar game modes (Deathmatch, Domination, Kill Confirmed, etc) and ranking. The loadout system has however been changed to a new ten-point system that is unlike any prior title in the series. Players are given 10 points to use on weapons, attachments, and perks, each costing 1 point. The game also introduces wildcards, players can choose up to 3, which allows players to break the rules of create-a-class by either, having three attachments on their primary weapon, two perks of the first tier, or more lethal grenades, but more points are used. The playercard, stats tracking and emblem creation from <em>Black Ops</em> return as well as theater mode and combat training (which is now integrated into multiplayer as a playlist). Dedicated servers return to the PC version albeit with restrictions. Players cannot host servers themselves; rather Activision hosts them and they must still be joined through the now standard matchmaking system. Killstreaks have been renamed scorestreaks as points now factor in as well as kills — encouraging less camping and more playing of the objective. New scorestreaks include lightning strikes (similar to napalm strikes and mortar strikes of the past), unmanned dragonfire drones which hunt down and kill enemy players, among others. Returning strikes include dogs, RC-XD exploding cars, and franchise standards such as the UAV and care packages. </p>\n<p>The <em>Call of Duty: Elite</em> service is now free and new league matches have been introduced. Similar to games like <a href=\"/search/?q=StarCraft+II\">StarCraft II</a>, league matches put a player into a division (Bronze, Silver, etc) after which they play on a competitive ladder with other players of similar skill. League games have comprehensive stat tracking and leaderboards available to all players through the Elite service.</p>\n<p>The Wii U version offer split-screen multiplayer with one player using the TV and another using the built-in display of the GamePad. In regular games the GamePad is used to customize the game to set up the loadouts and select the scorestreaks.</p>",

This is the first version of the game for the Nintendo Switch and it remastered with revamped high-definition visuals and modernized audio. The game supports a \nmodern dual-analog control setup as well as a more traditional setup inspired by the release of the game for the GameCube and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/42180/metroid-prime-trilogy/\">Metroid Prime Trilogy</a> for Nintendo Wii. There is a new casual difficulty option that reduces the amount of damage Samus takes in combat. Bonus content includes concept and development art for both the original game and the remaster as well as a soundtrack gallery and 3D character gallery.</p>",

As the Mushroom Kingdom prepares to celebrate the arrival of a comet that appears in the skies every hundred years, Princess Peach sends Mario an invitation to attend. As Mario arrives, Bowser and minions attack the Kingdom and once again kidnap the Princess... and her entire castle. Mario gives chase but is lost as the ship leaves the atmosphere and ends up on a space station built on the visiting comet overseen by the mysterious Rosalina. It's up to Mario to brave new galaxies, find the elusive Power Stars, and bring his friends home.</p>\n<p><em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> plays similarly to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3533/super-mario-64/\">Super Mario 64</a>, as Mario explores his latest 3D world defying gravity, crossing various terrains, and even running upside down across the planet surfaces. Bouncing from planet to planet, Mario must collect Star Bits and coins, using his usual jump attacks and spins (now controlled with movement from the Wii Remote). The Wii Remote is also used to collect out-of-reach Star Bits and also can be controlled by a second player.</p>\n<p>In addition, Mario can find new suits (similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7300/super-mario-bros-3/\">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>) that give him the ability to turn into the ghostly Boo Mario, the high-flying Bee Mario, launch fireballs as Fire Mario and skate across frozen lakes as Ice Mario. New challenges also await Mario including ray surfing, balancing on a high-speed ball, floating inside bubbles, and other challenges in his quest to get all 120 stars. Even Luigi lends a hand in the search, making valuable contributions to the adventure.</p>\n<p>Players can also take a snapshot of the worlds they've completed along with their best record times and send them to their friends via Wi-Fi.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Inside a casino, during one of their heists, the group known as Phantom Thieves of Hearts is cornered by the police. Unable to escape, the leader of the group (the game's protagonist) is put under arrest, and goes into interrogation. Thus he begins to tell his story.\nAfter defending a woman from being harassed by a powerful politician, the 16-year-old protagonist is charged with assault and put on probation, which results in expulsion from his school.\nFollowing this, the protagonist is transferred to Shujin Academy in Tokyo, being forced to live at a coffee shop by the name of Cafe Leblanc, under the supervision of a friend of his parents, Sojiro Sakura.\nAfter going to school and making a couple of friends, is when the story truly starts.</p>\n<p><em>Persona 5</em>, like its predecessors <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/23178/shin-megami-tensei-persona-3/\">Persona 3</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/38259/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4/\">Persona 4</a></em>, takes course during a whole school year and has elements of both social simulator and dungeon crawler.\nDuring day time, the player must attend classes, and can choose to spend his free time doing various side activities, like playing sports, fishing, exercising at the gym, watch T.V., going to the movies, going out with friends, taking part-time jobs and so on.\nThere is a new game mechanic, the Confidant system, which is akin to the Social Link system present in previous games, whose sole purpose is to increase interaction with other characters and building relationships. The stronger the bonds with others, the stronger the benefits (usually related to the Personas themselves).\nThis time around, and in reference to older entries in the Shin Megami Tensei franchise, the Personas are obtained through the negotiation system, where the player characters speak with the demons that are fought, and try to persuade them to join the party, through several dialogue options. Players can also demand money or items from the creature instead.\nThe Persona fusion system is still in place, allowing the player to create more powerful Personas by fusing existing ones, while in the Velvet Room.\nPersonas are obtained by visiting Palaces, the dungeons in this game, which are areas given physical form by the desires of corrupt individuals. Unlike previous entries, these dungeons are not procedurally generated, thus having the same layout each time they're visited.\nAlso returning from the first Persona game are guns, which have limited ammo.</p>\n<p>The visual presentation is based on the picaresque theme on which the story is founded upon, and is very blatant in the U.I. screens. The thematic color for <em>Persona 5</em> is red, just like <em>Persona 3</em> had blue for its main color theme, and <em>Persona 4</em> had yellow.\nThe game's soundtrack incorporates acid jazz elements, as well as hard rock elements during boss battles, making it distinct from previous titles.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Mario returns to the stars as the everlasting villain Bowser has kidnapped Princess Peach once more, this time while she was baking a cake. It's up to Mario once again to fight and defeat Bowser and Bowser Jnr, among numerous new villains and obstacles, to save Princess Peach.</p>\n<p>The basic goal of each level is to collect the golden star, either by reaching an end goal, collecting a number of smaller star bits, or defeating an end-level boss. The environment is a mixture of standard Mario stages filled with familiar evil characters and miniature planetoids with their own orbital gravity. Certain levels switch the perspective from 3D to 2D, mimicking the platform origins of the character, while others range from molten lava wastelands, ice caverns, or oceans. Unlike <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/31282/super-mario-galaxy/\">Super Mario Galaxy</a>, <em>Galaxy 2</em> features a more standardized level system, a number of galaxies split into smaller planetary levels that can only be reached by completing one planet, to open up the path to the next. To reach an end-level boss or open a bonus planet, you need to have discovered enough golden stars to unlock it. The hub world of the original has been replaced with a spaceship, shaped like Mario's head, which can be used to travel between Galaxies, as well as discover hidden 1-Ups. </p>\n<p><em>Galaxy 2</em> features further improvements in gameplay, with two new suits for Mario and the return of his faithful companion Yoshi. Mario's first new suit is the Cloud Suit, which allows him to create three safe but temporary cloud platforms. The second new suite is the Rock Suit which, while wearing it, allows Mario to roll up into a rock ball, which will be necessary to complete some challenges or defeat certain foes. Yoshi adds an element of speed, can eat most enemies in sight, and can reach higher areas that Mario cannot reach alone. The green dino can also eat certain fruit to bolster his move set, but only for a brief moment of time, such as a speed boost, the ability to float higher into the air or to see invisible platforms, especially handy in a Ghost House.</p>\n<p>Like the original <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> a second player can join the experience by pointing the Wii Remote on the screen to collect coins or fling star bits, however, this time they can also collect items that are out of the reach of Mario or Yoshi, and push back enemies in advance of the hero.</p>\n<p>To aid those too young or new to the franchise, a second DVD explains the ins and outs of the control system. Plus, if you get stuck along the way, you can also turn on the Super Guide, which gives control of Mario over to the AI to complete a tricky level for you. However, you don't win a proper star as a reward, only a bronze star. Various 'Hint TVs' are also dotted around certain levels to explain or introduce a new element to the gameplay.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Uncharted 2: Among Thieves</em> is the sequel to <a href=\"/search/?q=Naughty+Dog\">Naughty Dog</a>'s 2007 game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/31220/uncharted-drakes-fortune/\">Uncharted: Drake's Fortune</a>. The story picks up a few years where the first one left off, following the previous games fortune-hunting hero, Nathan Drake, as he searches around the globe to try to solve another of the world's unsolved historical mysteries; this time regarding the famous merchant/explorer Marco Polo, who in 1292, mysteriously came back from a journey having lost 13 ships and 500+ passengers, with no explanation ever given on what had happened to those ships. After Drake gains knowledge of an ancient relic and a mysterious Himalayan Valley that may be connected to Marco Polo, he sets out on an adventure to discover the secrets of Polo's lost fleet, which he hopes will lead him to one of history's greatest undiscovered treasures.</p>\n<p>The gameplay of <em>Uncharted 2</em> remains pretty similar to the first game. It consists of cover-based shoot-offs, fast-paced escape sequences, and death-defying stunts fairly reminiscent of those of the <a href=\"/search/?q=Indiana+Jones\">Indiana Jones</a> movies. Some notable changes include stealth-action segments in the game, which force you to move through certain areas hiding in cover from the hordes of pirates who await to kill you. The wall-climbing and cover mechanics have been heightened to a new extent, allowing free movement over walls and more items for Drake to use as protection. Drake spends most of the time alone, but during large parts of the game, he is also accompanied by fellow treasure hunter Harry Flynn, Elena, and Chloe where they are controlled by the computer. During certain sequences, Drake needs to solve minor puzzles and the most complex ones require him to study notes in a book. Some of the locations visited include Turkey, Borneo, and Nepal. </p>\n<p>Multiplayer modes are entirely new to the series. <em>Among Thieves</em> features both competitive and cooperative play, allowing you to play the game along with friends and people around the world. Competitive game modes include \"Deathmatch (Team Deathmatch)\", \"Plunder (Capture the Flag)\", \"Elimination\" and \"Chain Reaction\". Co-operative includes a mode called \"Gold Rush\", in which you along with two other people must work as a team to face off against waves of enemy AI as you guys try to capture treasures and return them back to your base. Each round does not only have more enemies, but they are a lot stronger too.</p>\n<p>Unlike in the original PS3 release, the PS4 release features only the single-player mode, not the multiplayer mode. However, the PS4 release features a photo mode where you can pause the game and make the current screen look like a photo.</p>",

Nathan Drake, once a treasure hunter, is now retired, living a quiet life and married to Elena, a girl he met on <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/31220/uncharted-drakes-fortune/\">one of his adventures</a>. Trying hard to stay off course of anything that would pull him back into the world of danger and adventure, he yields after his brother, whom he thought was dead, appears in his office and asks him for help.</p>\n<p>The story centers around the search for yet another hidden treasure, a 400 million dollar worth of treasure, which Nate and Sam tried to find in their younger days but leads they had just didn't pan out. This time, they need to get back on the trail of the treasure as Sam's life depends on it. All the while competing to the same goal with their ex-partner, Rafe, who teamed up with Nadine Ross, the leader of a mercenary outfit known as Shoreline.</p>\n<p>The gameplay style and chapter-based singleplayer story presentation follows the path of its predecessors, with some additional features such as a grappling hook which allows Nathan to climb, rappel, or swing across a chasm, and even combine that to take out enemy soldiers. Any tall grass can be used to hide and take out nearby mercenaries in a stealthy manner. During cutscenes, Nate is sometimes given an option how to reply which does not affect the overall story but changes the conversation path or the outcome of a given scene. In this game, a big emphasis is given to vehicles such as boats or cars, which can be driven around and even used to take out enemies blocking your way or pursuing you. During regular cover based combat, you can now mark enemy combatants to remain visible even when behind cover.</p>\n<p>After beating the game, there are lots of unlockables on which the player can spend earned points, from various artwork to new character outfits and different video modes. For example, the entire game can be played in a cel shaded graphic style.</p>",

The game has undergone some major changes. The graphics update and the addition of 3D effects is the biggest one. The touchscreen is now used to replace the old menu which required the player to push the start button, now the player can simply select an item by touching it on the screen. There is also gyroscopic technology which allows the player to aim by moving the system, this makes it easier to use weapons like boomerangs and slingshots. The game also contains the Master Quest version and a new \"boss challenge\" mode. For the newcomers, there is also a feature called \"visions\" that show the player how to complete certain tasks.</p>\n<p>Story-wise the game has remained the same: Link is a young boy who lives in the Kokiri Forest but is one day called to arms by the Deku Tree who tells him to leave the forest and find Princess Zelda. Link is told that he must stop the evil Ganondorf from taking over Hyrule. The game still has the same puzzles and the only change is that the Stone of Agony has been replaced by a \"Shard of Agony\" which does the same thing. The Master Quest is a version of the game with a mirrored world, new puzzles, and stronger enemies, but was already released on the Nintendo Gamecube.</p>",

Next to a tweaked engine for more graphical polish, there is an additional introduction. Players of the original <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Mass+Effect\">Mass Effect</a> could carry over a number of choices from the first title using a savegame. These involve events such as a romantic interest, a sacrifice near the end of the game, the main character's appearance and the statistics that had been built up. To resolve that and to bring PS3 owners up to speed with the storyline of the original game, a new chapter called <em>Genesis</em> was added. After determining the gender and look for Commander Shepard and playing the main introduction, <em>Genesis</em> is accessed. It is presented as an interactive comic where players get to relive the events of the first game and also determine the six major decisions that are carried over to the second game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Picking up six years after <a href=\"/search/?q=Resident+Evil+2\">Resident Evil 2</a>, the fourth game in the series follows a former cop (now US agent) Leon S. Kennedy to Europe on a top-secret mission to investigate the disappearance of the president's daughter Ashley. As Leon encounters unimaginable horrors, he must find out who or what is behind everything. Old friends...and enemies...lurk around every corner as Leon attempts to find out who is truly behind the kidnapping of the president's daughter.</p>\n<p><em>Resident Evil 4</em> is a major change from the previous installments. Instead of a fixed third-person perspective, the game features a new \"behind the back\" movement camera angle and an \"over the shoulder\" aiming feature that allows players to control their gun movement for specific body part hits. It features a brand new AI system and more open environments that allow enemies to work together to capture and corner Leon. Enemies are now humans, which allows them to climb up ladders, open doors, and use weapons throughout the game. </p>\n<p>The entire item system has also been revamped, so that smaller items no longer require an entire item space to hold. Instead, items take up blocks of space in a briefcase according to their real-life size, to allow for many more items and weapons. Leon can collect treasure from enemies or from the surrounding area, and visit the infamous \"merchant\" to purchase bigger briefcases, treasure maps, weapons upgrades, and powerful weapons such as the one-shot RPG.</p>\n<p>There is also <em>the Mercenaries</em> from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/140612/resident-evil-3/\">Resident Evil 3</a>, which allows the player to play survival scenarios as characters such as Hunk and even Albert Wesker himself.</p>",

        "description": "<p>God of War is a soft reboot of Sony's long-running series of action games. While the originals were set within Greek mythology, the new title takes place after the original games within the world of Norse mythology. Kratos now resides in Midgard along with his son Atreus. After encountering a mysterious stranger covered in tattoos, Kratos and Atreus set out on a long and dangerous journey through the Nine Realms to scatter his dead wife's ashes from atop the highest mountain peak in Midgard.</p>\n<p>Unlike the original games, God of War utilizes a freely controllable third-person camera. Kratos now makes use of the Leviathan Axe, which has frost-damaging capabilities to freeze enemies in place, and can be thrown and summoned back to Kratos' hand at will. Kratos also has a shield that can be used to block and parry incoming attacks. Kratos can also use his fists to attack enemies, this can stun enemies and allows Kratos to execute finishing moves. In addition, his son Atreus can fire arrows at enemies and summon animals. Attacking enemies and collecting certain items raises Kratos' rage meter. After it is full, Kratos can use Spartan Rage, which greatly increases his attack power and speed, making him virtually unstoppable for a short time. </p>\n<p>In addition to combat, Kratos can also use the axe for puzzle solving, by freezing certain mechanisms in place, or destroying runes to unlock chests.</p>\n<p>Exploration and combat yield experience points and silver. Both are used to upgrade Kratos' and Atreus' abilities, granting new combos or increasing attack power. Gear can be purchased and upgraded at shops to grant stat boosts to Kratos in an RPG-like fashion. Gear can also be further enhanced with enchantments.</p>\n<p>The game takes place in a semi-linear world that allows for some degree of exploration and backtracking, and offers a number of side actvities and tasks.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Portal 2</em> is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=014633098716\">Portal</a> and offers the same first-person puzzle-platform gameplay. Players continue the story by taking the role of the young woman Chell, who defeated the artificial intelligence computer system GLaDOS in the first game. After the events of the first game, she was placed in stasis until eventually woken up again. The sequel still takes place at Aperture Science Labs, but it is now overrun by decay and nature. Much more than in the first game, Chell moves past the clean test chambers and explores the gloomy industrial setting of the laboratory.</p>\n<p>Just like in the first game, the gameplay is based around portals. By shooting a starting portal and ending portal at suitable surfaces, certain uncrossable gaps can be bridged. Just like in the first game, there are also many test chambers where puzzles need to be solved, using cubes, turrets, platforms, and special portal tricks to gain a lot of speed. GLaDOS makes a return to tease Chell and she plots revenge for her destruction, but there are a large number of twists that make her role very different from in the first game. Chell receives help from Wheatley, a small robot who opens entrances for her and provides witty insights about the environment.</p>\n<p>New elements to the sequel's gameplay include light bridges, laser redirection, and paint-like gels, incorporated through the work of the student project <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/38896/tag-the-power-of-paint/\">Tag: The Power of Paint</a>. Gels provide extra speed, a jump, or neutralize the effects. They can also be used with objects such as cubes or turrets.</p>\n<p>The game’s two-player cooperative mode is entirely new and features its own entirely separate campaign with a unique story, test chambers, and two new player characters (Atlas and P-body). The PlayStation 3 version incorporates some elements of the Steamworks toolset and allows for cross-platform games against PC players.</p>",

Shulk finds himself caught in the struggle between the humans from Bionis and the machines from Mechonis. Along his quest to defeat the machines he will have to help the inhabitants of Bionis rebuild their world.</p>\n<p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em> is a Japanese-style role-playing game with several distinguishing characteristics. Exploring the vast world takes a significant part in the gameplay. Weather and day/night cycle influence the availability of quests and characters. In such an open world it is not uncommon to encounter creatures much stronger than what Shulk and his allies can manage. When the player dies he is teleported to the last save point with no penalty. Objectives can be completed in any order and many side quests are available. </p>\n<p>The fighting system resembles the one from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Final+Fantasy+XII\">Final Fantasy XII</a>. There is no \"battle screen\"; battles happen directly in the open field without transition. During the battle attacks are launched automatically at regular intervals. The player selects his actions via a menu. Aside from Shulk, the player can control a team of characters with various abilities. Team attacks are available to inflict extra damage. However, once the player enters a battle, characters cannot be switched, and all other allies are AI-controlled.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The witcher Geralt of Rivia once lived in the secluded mountain fortress Kaer Morhen, where he enjoyed a peaceful life with his beloved Yennefer and, together with his fellow witchers, trained a young girl named Ciri, the daughter of Emhyr var Emreis, Emperor of Nilfgaard. Following a prolonged memory loss and other turbulent events described in his previous adventures, Geralt eventually gets close to a reunion with Yennefer, whom he hasn't seen in a long time. Meanwhile, the Empire of Nilfgaard invades the Northern Kingdoms, and Geralt is contacted by the Emperor who asks him to find Ciri. In the midst of these events, a supernatural army known as the Wild Hunt appears in the region, threatening to obliterate everything in their path towards an unknown goal.</p>\n<p><em>Wild Hunt</em> is an action role-playing game, the third main installment in the Witcher series, and a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/51611/the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings/\">Assassins of Kings</a>. Most gameplay elements from the previous games have been carried over, including the usage of two sword types for different classes of enemies, usage of magic, a skill-based character growth, and an extensive alchemy system allowing Geralt to ingest mutagens for various benefits. Combat system has been slightly modified to allow smoother fighting against multiple opponents and usage of long-ranged weapons. Weapon and armor customization options have been noticeably increased. Like before, certain sections of the story are dictated by the player's moral choices, which are also present in the game's more prominent side quests.</p>\n<p>The main difference between this entry and the preceding installments are physical interactivity and the inclusion of open-world elements. Geralt can now jump, swim, dive, ride a horse, and travel by boat, making nearly every location in the game world accessible for exploration. While Geralt can not travel anywhere right away, each area he visits is significantly larger than before and contains many more optional locations. Geralt can use his witcher senses to track people and investigate mysterious occurrences. There is a night and day cycle, dynamic weather effects, as well as the possibility to craft one's own weapons and armor. During a few segments, Ciri becomes the playable character instead of Geralt.</p>",

His quest is supported by the other Olympians, who grant him gifts to help fight through the beings that protect the exit from the Underworld.</p>\n<p>The game is presented in an isometric view with the player in control of Zagreus. The player starts a run-through of the game by trying to fight their way through several rooms; the room layouts are pre-determined, but their order and the enemies that appear are randomly determined. The player has a primary weapon, a special attack, and a magic spell which they can use to take out enemies. Sometimes on clearing a room, one of the Olympians will provide a gift, a choice of three persistent boosts for that run that the player can select from; the gifts are themed based on the Olympian, for example with Zeus providing lightning damage effects. The player also collects in-game currency and potentially keys. Should Zagreus' health points drop to zero, he \"dies\" and ends back up facing his father, removing all gifts granted from the last run. In this area, before settling on a new quest, the player can use the currency to unlock permanent upgrades for Zagreus, or the keys to unlock different weapons.</p>",

        "description": "<p>From Capcom's Clover studios, the team behind <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/15795/viewtiful-joe-2/\">Viewtiful Joe 2</a>, comes a 3-D cell-shaded action game in the world of feudal Japan. <em>Ōkami</em> tells the tale of a wolf-goddess named Amaterasu who must prevent an evil being known as Orochi from taking over the beautiful world of feudal Japan. Ōkami takes the already well-established cell shading technique and turns it into a traditional Hokusai-style Japanese woodblock print visual.</p>\n<p>To give the player a sense of being in a painting, Amaterasu is given a paintbrush which the player can cut enemies down with, create bridges or wind, and restore the forest to its natural beauty. With each defeated enemy, color returns, and the natural life force slowly regenerates. While playing, players call up a canvas where they can draw with the celestial brush. New abilities and techniques are acquired as you progress.</p>\n<p>Ōkami is filled with large worlds and dungeons to explore on your quest to restore the lush trees and wildlife to their former glory. Many monsters and large epic boss battles come between Amaterasu and her goal. To fulfill her objective there will be many people along the way that will help her if she helps them.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In <em>Journey</em> the player controls a robed character through a vast desert with large areas that can be freely explored in any direction. No instructions are given, but a large mountain is shown in the far distance and the character moves towards it. The game does not have a HUD and provides no clear directions. There also are no hazards or obstacles that lead to death. The goal is to guide the character through a journey. The character can be moved around and is able to whistle, as a short burst or more powerful depending on how long the button is pressed. Whistling makes a symbol appear and it is used to activate glyphs in the environment. After a while the player also learns to fly by activating floating pieces of cloth in the environment. These lift the character into the air. It is then possible to float for a short time or glide down through the sand. Once \"charged\", it is possible to give a few short busts while in the air. Through the journey the flying abilities improve. When moving towards a platform, the character jumps on it automatically when it is low enough. The main challenge in the game is to find a way to progress, by activating bridges or finding a route.</p>\n<p>Players can enable an online function to activate a cooperative mode. Other games worldwide are scanned and when another player is in the same area, the characters appear in each other's games and can travel together. No direct communication is possible, but through movement and whistling indirect interaction is possible. Playing together with an anonymous player provides an additional advantage. When the characters are near each other, they charge the other character to enable a single flying charge. This is done automatically. No challenges need to be overcome through cooperation however; it is purely aesthetic similar to the communication between deer in <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/20608/the-endless-forest/\">The Endless Forest</a> rather than the cooperative gameplay of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/39974/between/\">Between</a> for instance. Players can also leave the other behind at any time. Next to the main goal to journey, it is possible to locate and activate hidden glyphs. These have no further effect on the gameplay. When the entire game is finished, the user names of the companions met along the way are shown.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Red Dead Redemption</em> is a free-roaming western game and the spiritual successor to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/13322/red-dead-revolver/\">Red Dead Revolver</a>. The game is set in 1911, where players take control of John Marston, an outlaw who is forced to turn on his peers when federal agents threaten his family. He is sent to the American frontier to capture his former gang members, especially the notorious leader Bill Williamson.</p>\n<p>In the open world, the player is free to follow the storyline or partake in the various events that occur while exploring the West; similar in overall design to <a href=\"/search/?q=Rockstar\">Rockstar's</a> <a href=\"/search/?q=Grand+Theft+Auto\">Grand Theft Auto series</a>. Horses are the main means of transportation, and the player can whistle for their mount at any time. Players can also visit towns, talk to other characters, and join or intervene in events such as public hangings, ambushes, and robberies. Many of these are random, including dangerous animal attacks and bandit ambushes. Other activities include hunting, gambling, duels, and standoffs, with guns as the main weapon. </p>\n<p>Based on the player's decisions, two morality systems (honor and fame) influence how the environment and other characters react to Marston. Marston can shoot while riding a horse and capture people by lasso, combined with a cover system with specific targeting or wildfire. In the recharging \"Dead Eye\" targeting mode, time is slowed down to target different enemies in specific locations, and then execute the shots in rapid succession. The player can also set up camps anywhere in the world to fast travel to known locations or save their game.</p>\n<p>Multiplayer is supported through free-for-all, team, and capture-the-flag modes, introducing crates with weapons and power-ups. Games start with a Mexican standoff where the survivor receives some extra time to gather items while the others are respawning. Similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/33867/grand-theft-auto-iv/\">Grand Theft Auto IV</a>, there is a continuous free-roaming mode where players can team up in posses to form a party and engage computer-controlled gangs. Posses are made up of a maximum of eight players and all multiplayer games support a maximum of sixteen players. During multiplayer, the characters can level up and gain access to new mount breeds, character models, and weapon skins.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Gears of War 2</em>, the sequel to <a href=\"/search/?q=882224054034\">Gears of War</a>, is a tactical third-person launched exclusively for the Xbox 360 as a spear point for the console's push into 2008's end-of-the-year holiday season.</p>\n<p>The game follows up six months after the events of the first game, when the detonation of the Lightmass Bomb managed to destroy most of the invading Locust army. The explosion also affected the environment however, and a disease called rustlung threatens mankind. After a while, giant holes suddenly appear that absorb entire cities at once. When Jacinto, the impenetrable safe haven for mankind, appears to await the same fate, the COG Delta Squad with protagonist Marcus Fenix has to go underground to launch a counter-offensive against the Locust who are behind the disappearances.</p>\n<p>Many known faces return to the game, as well as a cast of new support characters. There is a larger focus on the story, picking up on new threads and continuing old ones, with more attention to the history of the Locust and emotional encounters. Again, there are branching paths in certain levels. One of the stories further explored is Dominic Santiago's search for his lost wife Maria. The game's campaign mode takes the player through five acts with large-scale battles in different environments such as ruined cities, but also locations where ice or water is prominently present. During a few sequences there is also vehicular combat. The Reaver riding level for instance has on-rail shooter gameplay.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is still focused on the cover system, with the addition of new finisher moves, active reload benefits, new weapons (e.g. grenades that can be turned into proximity mines) and the ability to use enemies as meat shields. Entirely new to the game is mobile cover. There are three types of covers that can be planted at difficult sections to provide extra spots next to the regular scenery. Covers can now be deformed, but not taken away completely.</p>\n<p>Next to single-player, there is a cooperative campaign mode (split-screen or online) and each player can set a different difficulty level (based on health and damage). In the regular campaign mode, the simple controls to guide AI team mates have been removed entirely. The multiplayer portion offers fifteen maps (including remakes of existing ones). Online games offers a matchmaking system where players are matched according to their rank. Some of the new multiplayer modes are Submission (get an unfriendly AI character back to the capture point), Guardian (team deathmatch with one player is the VIP - similar to Assassination in the previous game - ; when the player is alive, the other can respawn infinitely, but - new in this mode - when he dies the other players are on their last life), Wingman (ten players are split in teams of two, both as the same character), and King of the Hill (previously only featured in the <a href=\"/search/?q=882224531900\">PC version of the first game</a>).</p>\n<p>There is a cooperative Horde mode where up to five players play together in 50 waves of the Locust horde. More camera modes are present in the multiplayer games and players can take photos of the action to upload them to the official website.</p>",

It ties up all of the loose plot points of the previous games while bringing back a number of characters from the earlier games in the series such as Colonel Campbell, Naomi Hunter, Otacon, Meryl Silverburgh, Mei Ling, and many more. The game's main antagonist is Liquid Ocelot. Most of the story and the relationship are explained through cut-scenes with a considerable length. Due to the series extensive history, knowledge of the prior games is recommended to fully understand the story.</p>\n<p>As the story begins Solid Snake, now looking like an old man due to accelerated aging, is being deployed in the Middle East on a mission to stop Liquid Ocelot. The game is set in 2014, five years after the Big Shell Incident of <a href=\"/search/?q=Metal+Gear+Solid+2\">Metal Gear Solid 2</a>. Liquid aims to take control of the Sons of the Patriots, the nanomachine system used to enhance the capabilities of the mercenaries of different factions. By this, he plans to assemble an army. The game is divided into five acts followed by an epilogue and a briefing. The various missions bring Old Snake to more than one location, including the Middle East, South America, Eastern Europe, and a few more that can surprise the players familiar with the franchise.</p>\n<p>In this game, all of the actions of the previous game have been included along with some new ones such as the ability to roll on your back and fire and the ability to hide in bins scattered around the environment. Similar to the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/21633/metal-gear-solid-3-subsistence/\">Subsistence</a> re-release of MGS3, the player has full control of the camera rotation on one analogue stick while walking with the other. Shooting is now enhanced to support a new shoulder camera not seen in the franchise before, much similar to that of <a href=\"/search/?q=Resident+Evil+4\">Resident Evil 4</a> which will help you to easily counter-attack the enemy without having to fire randomly or switching to 1st-person perspective. The Close Quarters Combat system has been redesigned and players are now able to interrogate guards for information or supplies. The earlier camouflage system has been replaced with Octocamo that allows Snake to blend into the environment. The stamina meter from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/15735/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater/\">Snake Eater</a> has been replaced by a stress meter. Based on the fighting and the climate conditions it can offer additional accuracy and reduce sustained damage. The other meter, Psyche, reduces accuracy and can be replenished by reading an adult magazine, eating, or drinking.</p>\n<p>Snake has access to the largest arsenal of weapons ever made available in a Metal Gear game, with a large array of pistols, rifles, and explosives, along with the ability to mod the weapons adding scopes, suppressors, lights, and other equipment to create custom weapons.</p>\n<p>Other gadgets in the game include the Solid Eye, which is an electronic eye patch that can be used as binoculars, night vision goggles, or just a device for displaying information about enemies and items scattered around the levels. There is also the Metal Gear Mk. II, which is a small robot that can be used to scout levels and electrocute enemies knocking them out for a period of time.</p>\n<p>The game also features a complex multiplayer mode, simply entitled Metal Gear Online. Aside from the usual suspects of multiplayer shooter modes, such as \"deathmatch\" and \"capture the flag\", there are some original modes that are based on the stealth aspects of the single-player games. \"Sneaking Mission\" mostly plays out like a standard team deathmatch, with the exception that one player is assigned to control Snake, who is equipped with his radar and Octocamo. Snake's goal is to tranquilize his enemies in order to acquire their dog tags, without getting spotted. If there are enough players in the game, one player will also control Metal Gear Mk.II to assist Snake. \"Team Sneaking\" is basically \"Capture the flag\", in which the attacking team is equipped with stealth camouflage and non-lethal weapons. The defending team can only see the attacking team's shadows and weapons.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This <em>Resident Evil 2</em> is a remake of the original game with the same title that came out 20 years and four console generations earlier. In terms of story and gameplay, the game tries to stay true to the original. Even reading collected notes and handling inventory items feels purposely outdated with less real-time feel to capture the original feel. The graphics are pretty much the main boost that separates this game from the original, and it runs on RE Engine introduced in <a href=\"/search/?q=Resident+Evil+7\">Resident Evil 7</a>.</p>\n<p>The story follows Leon S. Kennedy, a rookie police officer coming to work on his first day at Raccoon precinct. Alternate story follows Claire Redfield, who came to Raccoon city in search of her brother, Chris, who is also a S.T.A.R.S. team member. The game, just like the original, is intended to be played with both characters, where second playthrough with different character will unlock additional locations and complete the story. Thus the story works the same if played first as Leon and then Claire, or first as Claire and then Leon. The stories aren't entirely in parallel and replaying with a different character, while opens new locations, cutscenes and boss battles, will also force player to unlock the same lockers, doors and paths that the other player did on the first playthrough. During the main story, Sherry, in Claire's story, and Ada Wong, in Leon's story, are playable for a bit.</p>\n<p>By completing the game, new gameplay modes get unlocked which feature other characters such as Hunk or Tofu Survivor. While the original game used fixed scenes with pre-rendered background and tank controls for the characters, this remake uses real-time 3D graphics with shoulder camera and directional controls. Many locations and cut-scenes are recreated to match the original, though there are also entirely new areas included in this remake that the original game didn't feature. Similar to original RE2, various artwork can be unlocked by collecting it throughout the game. Unlocked artwork and 3D models can be accessed via main menu.</p>\n<p>Unlike the original game, this release has various DLCs which add new outfits and weapons to use in the game. Some of the bonus outfits, such as the original 1998 outfits with new graphics, however, become available upon completing the main story. Similar to Chris Redfield's new character facial seen in RE7, both Leon and Claire deviate from their standard looks due to Capcom using motion-capture for character facials so they looked for an actor with close resemblance to the original character not to go way off the familiar appearance.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>LittleBigPlanet</em> is a puzzle platformer where the player controls sackboys. It takes the characters on an adventure through levels with different themes and settings, trying to reach the end of each level alive. The platforming is based entirely on physics where the sackboys can push or pull items, or generally manipulate them with their movement or weight. In addition to running, jumping, pushing and pulling, it is also necessary to master grabbing dangling objects and swinging from them to get over some obstacles and traps.</p>\n<p>The game can be played by up to four players simultaneously with some puzzles requiring more than one player to be solved. Levels consists of three planes: foreground, middle, and background, which can be traversed.</p>\n<p>Next to the main game with about 50 levels, a large portion is devoted to creating user generated content. Players can design their own levels and devise custom rules. The objects used to build up the levels are largely based on the characteristics of real world materials emulated by the physics engine.</p>\n<p>During the course of a level, stickers can be picked up for (mostly) decorative purposes or new items used to dress up the sackboys or for inclusion in the player's own levels. User created content can be shared via the PlayStation Network.</p>",

Gameplay is similar to the predecessors but with some minor changes. Kratos goes through levels killing enemies and bosses, solving box-based puzzles and doing quick time events. He also collects red orbs to power up his weapons and abilities, Gorgon eyeballs to increase his health and Phoenix feathers to increase his magic power.</p>\n<p>The game's controls were adjusted to fit the PSP's reduced amount of buttons. Both the shoulder buttons and the analog stick are now required in order to dodge. The most well-known God of War weapon, the Blades of Chaos, are also present. There are several new weapons and magic spells available, including Sun Shield, Efreet spell and Light of Dawn. The game starts when the Gods send Kratos to the city of Attica to defend it from the invading Persian army. But later when Morpheus strikes, Kratos will need to use all his power to save the world once again.</p>",

In the career mode, winning races unlocks manufacturer relationships and you can earn money to buy new cars or customize your vehicles. This mode is expanded over Xbox Live with human opponents.</p>\n<p>Forza also includes Drivatar technology, where you can train the computer AI to copy your driving skills (the way you approach corners, the amount of brake applied) and then let the AI race for you to move quickly past certain courses. Over Xbox Live, you can organize your own competitions, start a car club with a team of drivers, exchange cars, download ghost cars to improve your race times, compete on over 1400 leaderboards and acquire new car setups.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Batman: Arkham City</em> is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/42258/batman-arkham-asylum/\">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a> and once again stars the masked superhero Batman as the protagonist. The game takes place a year and a half after the events of the original game. After Joker was stopped from taking over the asylum, the asylum's former warden Quincy Sharp claims the responsibility for having averted disaster and he uses the popularity to become mayor of Gotham City. To suppress crime further, an enormous open-air prison called Arkham City is built. Citizens (as well as journalists in particular) are under strict supervision and the slightest disturbance is sufficient to be transferred to the prison. Sharp is assisted by psychiatrist Hugo Strange and hires the armed forces of the rogue security firm TYGER Security to maintain order. The story for Batman starts when he, as Bruce Wayne, is sent to Arkham City after declaring his opposition to the facility in a press conference. Strange is aware of Wayne's dual identity, but he can escape from the Penguin and gets his gear back through an airdrop from Alfred Pennyworth, which allows him to turn into Batman and fight the facility from the inside. Much of the story also revolves around a strange disease called the Titan formula that has infected Joker, and a secret plan called Protocol 10. Other famous characters from the franchise that make an appearance include Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, Rā's al Ghūl, and Clayface.</p>\n<p>The game has an open-world environment for Batman to explore with secondary objectives and paths next to the main storyline. Just like the first game, Batman has access to a large amount of melee fighting moves that can be chained into combos and throws, as well as a large arsenal of gadgets used in combat, to solve puzzles, or to travel through the environment. Most situations offer the choice to go head-on, or move more silently by gliding and using stealth. At the start of the game Batman has all the gadgets from the first game, with improved abilities, and new ones become available later on. The improved abilities include the use of the grappling hook while gliding to reach higher areas, the line launcher that can also act as a tightrope with a flipping mechanic to launch another line in a different direction, built-in boost and brake for the Batarang, and the ability to track signals through the cryptographic sequencer. Some of the new gadgets allow Batman to freeze enemies and water with ice grenades, detonate explosive and jam weapons with a disruptor, confuse enemies with smoke, power electrical equipment, and shock enemies with a taser.</p>\n<p>Still present from the original game is the Detective mode, a form of augmented reality where evidence and enemies become clearer. It is now used more often for forensic puzzles, for instance, to trace the origin of items. Batman also has access to a criminal database. For the secondary quests, he often has to collect trophies hidden by the Riddler, with 440 challenges in total.</p>\n<p>In addition to Batman, the game can also be played as Catwoman for a series of missions in the main campaign. She is enabled by entering a single-use code provided with each new copy of the game for the Xbox 360 and PS3. For the PC it was slip-streamed into the game right away. Catwoman has a different, more acrobatic fighting style with bolas, whips, and claws. The Detective mode is called Thief Vision for her and allows her to steal items. Some secondary puzzles can only be completed as Catwoman. The console versions support a stereoscopic 3D mode.</p>",

Ninja Dog mode is also included for fans who felt the game on normal was too hard. This is unlocked by dying three consecutive times on the first chapter in normal mode. There are also two more levels of difficulty (very hard and master ninja), which are unlocked consecutively with the completion of the game on the previous difficulty setting.</p>\n<p>There are new enemies not included in the original release of the game and a new weapon called Lunar First seen in the Hurricane bonus packs. Mission mode includes 50 missions. Those who have ever played the Xbox Live! downloadable Hurricane packs (also included in this release) will be familiar with these. The missions are of varying length and difficulty. Your score is tracked for an online leaderboard over Xbox Live!, so you can compare your ninja prowess with your peers.</p>\n<p>There are some new in-game cutscenes.\nAll three Ninja Gaiden games from the <a href=\"/search/?q=Nintendo\">Nintendo</a> era have been removed for a faithful emulation of the Ninja Gaiden arcade game originally released in the late eighties (which even requires to press a button to simulate the act of inserting a coin in the coin-op machine to start playing)</p>",

The second chapter of the series focuses once more on a tale of revenge. Having defeated Ares and now a god himself, Kratos proves to be a more vicious and power-hungry god than Ares ever was. Eventually he finds himself betrayed, with his godly powers and abilities removed from him. Kratos sets upon another epic quest to find the Sisters of Fate and do what no mortal or god has ever done: change his destiny and reclaim his power.</p>\n<p>Like its predecessor, <em>God of War II</em> is an action game with platforming and puzzle-solving elements. Still utilizing the Blades of Chaos, Kratos must rip apart his enemies and and other gods, heroes, and monsters from the Greek myths that stands in his way to revenge and power. As before, the higher the combo achieved from killing an enemy, the more red orbs will be awarded to Kratos for upgrades. Kratos has a selection of spells which utilize the blue orbs. Some are familiar from the previous game, while others are new to the sequel and its storyline.</p>\n<p>In addition to the action and light puzzle-solving, Kratos takes to the sky in the sequel with some rail-based flying levels on the back of either a Pegasus or gryphon. He also learns several new abilities for combat as well as for solving the puzzles in the game, such as for example the ability to slow down time.</p>\n<p>Included with the game is a second disc that has such bonus features as deleted levels, the voices of <em>God of War II</em>, the musical score, and a documentary about bringing the game to life.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Twilight Princess</em> is the first Legend of Zelda game for the Wii and also the last for GameCube. At first, Link is a simple farm boy, whose tasks consist of herding goats to watching children in Ordon village, Link's hometown. One day, Link is asked by the mayor to run an errand in Castle Town, but things suddenly go wrong…</p>\n<p>The land becomes dark, and strange creatures appear from another world called the Twilight Realm, which turns most into ghosts. Link, however, becomes a wolf. After becoming a wolf, Link is aided by Midna, a resident of the Twilight Realm. Midna helps Link find a way to turn human again along with other tasks.</p>\n<p>The wolf cannot use a sword or other items. Instead, as a wolf Link must use his senses to solve puzzles and get past obstacles. The beast can also dig holes to find hearts and rupees and to get in places. It can push blocks with its head to climb higher or reveal hidden passageways. Additionally, it can attack enemies by biting or pouncing on them.</p>\n<p>As a human, Link can move around quickly, aim his bow, swing his sword, and even fish. Link also collects many different items, which allow him to perform varied attacks and reach places he couldn't before. Link performs many attacks with his sword and can even learn other sword moves.</p>\n<p>The game's art is similar to the naturalistic style of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/3549/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/\">Ocarina of Time</a>, rather than the cel-shaded look of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/8725/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker/\">The Wind Waker</a>. Chronologically, the game takes place between the two aforementioned titles, and quite a few locations from <em>Ocarina of Time</em> can be visited. The main adventure takes place in several provinces with dungeons and temples. With the help of Midna, you can easily travel around quickly later in the game.</p>\n<p>The Wii U remaster of the game includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhanced graphics</li>\n<li>Wii U GamePad support (allowing for a mini-map to be displayed on the touchscreen, or items to be changed using the touchscreen)</li>\n<li>Miiverse support</li>\n<li>Some areas of gameplay have had minor adjustments</li>\n<li>A new difficulty mode</li>\n<li>A new dungeon, the Cave of Shadows, which is accessed using the Wolf Link amiibo</li>\n<li>Additional amiibo support for health refills or arrow refills</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><em>Super Smash Bros.: Brawl</em> is the third game in the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/508/super-smash-brothers-series/\">Super Smash Brothers series</a> of brawling games. It is a crossover fighting pitching well-known characters from Nintendo franchises, along with characters from other series, against each other. The battles take place in 41 stages with up to four players fighting at the same time. New stages can be designed using the included Stage Builder. Unlike other fighting games, players do not need to drain the opponent's health. Instead, the game is won when a player manages to knock the opponent off the stage, although some games modes only award a point to the victorious player, continuing the fight. The fighting itself does have an influence however. The character's vitality is represented by a percentage. Starting at zero, the higher it becomes, the further the character flies away when hit, improving the chances to have him disappear off the stage. Characters have certain recovery moves to get back, but each stage has a certain boundary from where no return is possible.</p>\n<p>Each character has basic and advanced attacks (smash attacks), as well as character-specific special moves. They can also make use of items, projectiles, custom weapons and other items. This edition introduces super attacks referred to as final smashes. Activated by destroying smash balls, these feature powerful and often unstoppable attacks, regularly introducing a major transformation of the character. Other help is introduced through assist trophies (a computer-controlled character temporarily helping out) and Poké balls (a character from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/475/pokemon-universe/\">Pokémon universe</a> joins the fight).</p>\n<p>The single-player mode is called <em>The Subspace Emissary</em> and features cut-scenes with all playable characters. It is team-based, and new characters will temporarily join or leave the team for which the player can determine the battle order. Other modes include Classic (a series of matches), Events with pre-determined battle conditions - also for co-op, and the Stadium mode with mini-games such as Home-Run Contest and Target Smash!</p>\n<p>There are 35 playable characters in total (both old and new, with some removed from previous iterations), and certain characters can acquire alternate fighting styles or transformations making a total of 37 selectable.

        "description": "<p><em>Company of Heroes</em>, from the developers of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/15117/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war/\">Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War</a>, is a real-time strategy game that drops you into the fray of World War II Europe. From the bloody beaches of Omaha to the deadly firefights of the Bocage, you attempt to lead your troops to victory one battle at a time. The game comes with three modes of play -- single-player campaign, single-player skirmish and online multiplayer. All the missions in the single-player campaign take place during the Battle of Normandy (codename Operation Overlord) and are played from the perspective of the American Able Company (part of the 29th Infantry Division) and Fox Company (101st Airborne Division). More varied maps are available in the skirmish and multiplayer modes, including many added through patches.</p>\n<p>What really sets <em>Company of Heroes</em> apart from other real-time strategy games, much like <a href=\"/search/?q=Relic+Entertainment\">Relic Entertainment's</a> previous entry, is that you no longer train and control individual troops. Instead you deploy squads of soldiers. Players must train a balanced assortment of units in order to obtain victory over their adversaries. Most units can be upgraded and equipped with special accessories that are either more powerful or suited for specific tasks. For example, the M4 \"Crocodile\" Sherman can smash through hedgerows when equipped with the Bulldozer upgrade. This is normally impossible for tanks in the game. Allied units can also advance through a progression system that awards XP for killing enemies and destroying hostile structures, while Axis units gain veterancy at the Kampfkraft Center through research. In both cases they become more effective in combat.</p>\n<p>There's also a progression system for the players themselves, called Company Commander. It rewards XP for successful attacks and controlling territory sectors, which can then be invested in a two-branched ability tree. Each faction has three ability trees. The Allied forces trees include Infantry Company, Airborne Company and Armor Company, while the Axis has the Defensive Doctrine, Blitzkrieg Doctrine and Terror Doctrine. The nature of the abilities are diverse. Some may be used to call airborne support, including bombardment, while others can call in special units such as paratroopers, the King Tiger or the Calliope Rocket Launcher. At the same time, there are others which can give temporary bonuses to existing troops or capabilities to units that normally can't perform them. This way, riflemen can be used to construct defensive structures (tank traps, sandbags etc.), for example.</p>\n<p>Resource gathering has gone in a different direction from that of other RTS games. Players must attempt to capture and control strategic points which bring in the much needed resources of manpower, munitions and fuel to build and train new units. At the same time it's necessary to have the right base buildings to deploy units on the battlefield, such as a tank depot to create tanks, barracks for riflemen, and motor pools for light armored vehicles. Only the Allied engineers and the Axis pioneers can raise new buildings, but some missions may start with a full or partial base already up and running. The Allies and the Axis generally have different types of base structures and combat units.</p>\n<p>The game's Essence engine brings a level of depth to RTS games with deformable terrain and completely destructible environments. Units will take cover in burnt out craters and tanks can decimate buildings suspected of containing snipers.</p>",

There is more focus on circuit racing and the point-to-point races have been removed.</p>\n<p>There are 12 tracks in 47 different configurations (both fictional and existing) and over 300 cars with a unique feel that can be modified to the smallest details, mechanical and cosmetic. Cars are classified as Production Cars or Race Cars divided over different classes. Every mechanical part influences the car behaviour and sound, stressing the focus on realism. There are 3 settings: Simulation (large impact of crashes), Limited (light crashes and only a small amount of damage) and Cosmetic (only visible damage, not affecting the car's performance).</p>\n<p>The game modes include a career mode with different classes, time trials, free runs and arcade races. In the career mode, winning races unlocks manufacturer relationships and you can earn money to buy new cars or customize your vehicles. This mode is expanded over Xbox Live with up to 8 human opponents. Players can buy and sell cars through the game's Auction House.</p>",

The game is all about pulling off fantastic combos with precise timing as you face a number of memorable battles in a variety of locations.</p>\n<p>By dodging incoming attacks at the last second, Witch Time is activated, slowing down time with an opportunity to retaliate. This technique is also used to solve environmental puzzles. Once again additional points are earned through torture attacks where enemies can be trapped in infernal devices. As in the previous game there is a large amount of customization for the weapons Bayonetta can use with both hand and feet. Umbran Climax is a new gameplay element.

        "description": "<p><em>Gears of War</em> is a tactical third-person shooter where the player controls Marcus Fenix, a member of Delta Squad, to save the human inhabitants of the fictional planet Sera from an enemy known as The Locust Horde. The story, played over 5 acts with 30 chapters in total, has the humans reunite their strength after fighting over cheap energy in the Pendulum Wars for many years, to face this new alien threat.</p>\n<p>Unlike many other shooters, the emphasis is not on brute violence, but rather team-based actions and cover-dependent tactics. Gameplay requires looking for cover options all the time, from which the player then attacks, along with turns and rolls to quickly pop out. By holding a button, a \"roadie run\" is performed, to sprint to another location. Marcus is part of a full squad, but another human player can take on the role of Dominic Santiago to fight cooperatively (split-screen, system link, or online). At times, the paths will even be split up to face different challenges. Players can only hold two weapons, a sidearm, and a few grenades. There is a selection of submachine guns, sniper and assault rifles, grenades, grenade launchers, and pistols, but the main gun is the COG Lancer Assault Rifle, which can also be used as a chainsaw bayonet in close combat. There are also a few exotic weapons, such as the Torque Bow with explosive arrows, or the Hammer of Dawn, to make an orbiting satellite fire a laser at targeted enemies.</p>\n<p>All weapons need to be reloaded manually. By timely pressing a button on a meter, the weapon is reloaded, with more damage and at a faster rate with perfect timing, or it gets jammed when timed poorly. Instead of a health bar, the game has the Crimson Omen, a cog-shaped icon that fills up with blood when the player sustains damage.</p>\n<p>In addition to Co-op multiplayer, there is also Versus which has three game modes: Warzone (deathmatch), Execution (deathmatch, but with the addition of \"fatalities\" to take out enemies completely), and Assassination (focus on killing each other opponent's team leader).</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Rayman Legends</em> is a 2D platform game and a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/53772/rayman-origins/\">Rayman Origins</a>. After the events of the previous game Rayman, Globox, and the Teensies went to a century-long sleep. During that time new nightmares have appeared in the world and the Magician (who was defeated in <em>Rayman Origins</em>) has been split into five dark teensies. These nightmares and dark teensies have captured the princesses of the land (including a new playable character Barbara) and other teensies. Naturally, Rayman and his friends are awoken once again to right the wrongs. </p>\n<p><em>Rayman Legends</em> retains the graphical style and most gameplay elements of <em>Rayman Origins</em>. Up to four players can simultaneously progress through side-scrolling levels defeating enemies and collecting Lums. On each level, there is a number of teensies to rescue and that opens up new levels and worlds. All the powers from the previous game (wall-running, air gliding, etc.) are available to the characters from the start, but some new gimmicks are added, for example, the ability to fire projectiles on some levels. Murfy the greenbottle appears on some levels to aid the players. With a press of a button, he operates machinery, pokes bigger enemies, and opens up passages for the characters. In some versions of the game, the fifth player can control Murphy's movement. </p>\n<p>The game includes regular side-scrolling levels, \"invaded\" versions of levels that need to be completed as quickly as possible and rhythm-based levels with a soundtrack consisting of humorous covers of popular songs. In addition, forty remastered levels from <em>Rayman Origins</em> can be unlocked by collecting Lucky tickets. The game offers daily and weekly challenges and a local multiplayer soccer mini-game titled Kung Foot.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Blood and Wine</em> is the second and last commercial story downloadable content for <a href=\"/search/?q=Wied%C5%BAmin+3%3A+Dziki+Gon\">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> which follows the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/75378/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-hearts-of-stone/\">Hearts of Stone</a> and advises players to have Geralt be around level 35-40 before undertaking the new adventure. While the mission starts near Novigrad and Oxenfurt, it soon moves to a whole new place on the world map, the southern region of Toussaint, a complete new realm, untouched by war, modelled after the wine regions of southern France.</p>\n<p>In this new region, the primary quest is focused on catching an unknown beast that is plaguing the area and killing noble knights. Nobody knows exactly what the beast looks like or even what type of a beast it is, just that it's swift, deadly, and very powerful. Still adhering to the main game, Geralt can complete the main quest or venture on the optional various side quests. While the base game had side quests and missions marked with yellow exclamation mark, <em>Hearts of Stone</em> used blue color, and this add-on uses red exclamation mark to mark its own unique quests and items.</p>\n<p>This DLC introduces great many new characters, as well as some that Geralt has crossed paths with in his earlier adventures, both in predecessor games, such as Lady of the Lake, as well as those outside the scope of Witcher games released thus far. That said, there are plenty of new monsters and beastiary as well. Some being more deadly variations of existing ones, the other being completely new and local to the region of Toussaint. As this region will require higher character level and tougher weapons and armor, there are many new swords, crossbows and protective armor available, even the next level of long lost witcher gear diagrams which allows manufacturing of some of the most powerful equipment so far. The new thing introduced in this DLC are dye colors which allow Geralt to give certain color to his armor, however, it only works on witcher gear, not on any other armor.</p>\n<p>Many of the quests and missions are rather original in content and type to what was shown in the base game thus far, and while it may be expected for an add-on to add more of the same in a different manner, there are great many original contents in this region, from vineyards and mediterranean building types to folks' outfits and actions, plethora of new inventory items, flora and fauna, monsters, characters, and even new soundtrack, instrumental and vocal, tailored to fit the new setting.</p>\n<p>Very soon in this sub-story Geralt will be given a plot of land with a house and vineyard as a form of payment for the task he is undertaking, following by an optional quest of renovating his house, the barn and the lands around it. By renovating and building new things, Geralt will be able to peruse them for temporary skill boost. Sleeping in his own bed may give him boost in vitality or his horse ability to carry more things for a given time. Renovating the vineyard and gardens will give him access to various herbs for brewing potions. And buying weapon racks and such will let him put his swords and armor in the lobby for display.</p>\n<p>This add-on also provides further upgrades for the character skill tree. Although presented as a secondary quest, Geralt will be able to inspect a laboratory of a scientist who tried to suppress Witcher mutations only to find out he instead increased their strength. Undergoing the same process will give Geralt access to additional skill tree which will act as a an enhancement on top of existing one.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Last of Us</em> is a survival horror action game. The story focuses on the two characters Joel and Ellie. The game starts in a contemporary, but post-apocalyptic version of Boston twenty years after the outbreak of the Cordyceps Brain Infection (CBI), an infection spread by a mushroom that turns anyone infected into zombie-like creatures in two days. The opening sequence is set during the outbreak and it has Joel escape the invaded city with the help of his brother Tommy. Twenty years later, civilization is almost entirely destroyed. Independent groups of survivors have organized themselves into military outfits that quarantine zones, hold curfew, and distribute rations. Others are part of the resistance group the Fireflies, while Joel is a member of an independent group. Together with his friend Tess, he survives by smuggling goods in and out of the city. During a mission, they get into contact with a Fireflies member who offers stolen weapons back if they escort the 14-year-old girl Ellie out of the city. After some events and revelations about Ellie's importance, Joel and Ellie end up together and their journey is documented in the course of a year and a few months, spread over five seasons.</p>\n<p>The player controls Joel from a third-person perspective. Ellie can also be controlled by herself for some extensive parts in the later chapters. Similar to the developer's previous <a href=\"/search/?q=Uncharted\">Uncharted</a> games, gameplay combines action elements, exploration, and puzzle-solving. Joel is however not as strong or acrobatic and he often needs to use ladders, planks, and other items to climb and get around. Similarly, the survival horror theme with limited ammo and health makes him very vulnerable to attacks and a stealth approach is often more effective. Enemies include various five types of infected (Runners, Stalkers, Clickers, Bloaters, and Spore Cadavers) each with their own characteristics, but also humans from the military groups and other survivors. There is a selection of close and long-ranged guns, along with melee weapons that can be modded, regular fist fighting, and items such as Molotov cocktails, smoke bombs, and nail bombs. Ammo is very limited and initially, the reloading speed and firing rate are slow. Melee weapons can only be used a few times before they break down.</p>\n<p>More can be achieved through stealth. Joel is able to duck and sneak around at various speeds, and he can activate a hearing sense that allows him to vaguely see and hear silhouettes through walls based on sounds. By sneaking up on an enemy, it can be taken out through strangling, a quick kill with a shiv, or another type of takedown. Certain enemies are blind and only react to sound. As soon as Joel is detected, other enemies are warned and the player has to decide upon confrontation or breaking the line of sight by hiding for some time. During attacks or when being held there are often short quick time events to break free, but for some enemies, a single hit is deadly right away. Further possibilities include sprinting, using a flashlight in dark areas, and swimming. Joel can pick up bottles or bricks and throw them to distract enemies. Certain enemies can be stunned by throwing at them directly. Cover is based on line of sight and is not performed through a separate action. It is achieved automatically by moving behind objections and Joel is not glued to his cover position, as both sound and line of sight entirely determine the cover's effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Progress through the story and the environment is entirely linear, but there is some focus on exploration along with small optional areas. The city is almost entirely destroyed and the characters move through the debris and abandoned houses, but there are also parts where nature has taken back the environment and lush scenery outside the city. Next to Boston and the surrounding environment, the characters visit Pittsburgh, Colorado, and Salt Lake City eventually. A large part of the exploration is needed to gather items. Various tools and items can be collected to craft them into items such as health kits, shivs, Molotov cocktails, (smoke) bombs, modded melee weapons, and more. Supply is limited, so the player has to choose between offensive and defensive means. At workbenches gears, bolts, and other metals are used to improve the characteristics of weapons such as firing rate, reloading speed, weapon sway, and ammo capacity. The full range of upgrades only becomes available when up to five levels of tool skills have been unlocked. Supplement pills collected along the way are used to improve the overall skills influencing maximum health, hearing capacity, crafting speed, and more. Abilities can also be upgraded by locating training manuals. Ellie and other AI companions are controlled automatically and can never be detected or hurt by opponents, except for a few specific sequences. There is a lot of focus on conversations along the way, as well as the relationship between the characters. This is also furthered through various cut-scenes, both rendered and in-game.</p>\n<p>Multiplayer is called Factions with matches for up to eight players simultaneously. In the beginning, the player chooses between the Hunters of Fireflies factions with a custom character. The initial faction selection cannot be reversed until the clan has been defeated or the multiplayer story has been completed. The story consists of a light narrative that frames the various encounters, as the aim is to help a clan grow and survive. Players are organized in clans, but these can also be populated with friends' names through a Facebook connection. While playing various status updates about the members are shown, as they are sent out to fight, locate supplies, etc. Multiplayer progresses by one day at a time by playing matches in one of the two game modes: Supply Raid and Survivors. Both are team deathmatch variations, with a finite pool of 20 teams respawns in the former and one life per round in the latter. Just like the single-player, the focus is mostly on stealth and gathering supplies to craft. Ammo is also limited and the Listen mode from the single-player is available, but only for a short duration and as a specific perk. Crafted items can be used in-game or can be saved to further the clan's status in the larger frame as supplies act as a currency. Sometimes there are specific objectives such as a set number of kills to have the clan grow. Characters can be customized, there is a perk system with survival skills and an overall experience system, and clans can be populated with AI-controlled characters. Character classes consist of Assault, Sniper, Support, and Stealth, and a custom one can also be created.</p>",

There's no storyline: it's all about becoming the best driver of the world by finishing first in races through famous cities, such as Chicago, Edinburgh, Florence, Barcelona, Washington, Hong Kong and Moscow.</p>\n<p>The kudos system, which awards points based on driving style, has been improved. Perform power slides, 360° turns, drive on two wheels or stay in the slipstream of your opponents to build up a stash. With those points, you can unlock new venues and faster race monsters, such as the Ferrari Enzo, Porsche GT2, BMW Z4, Pontiac GTO, Mini Cooper S and many others.</p>\n<p>The game can be played both over System Link or Xbox Live. You can race friends online or download ghosts of the fastest drivers all around the world to improve your own skills.</p>\n<p>Each city has its own soundtrack, but you can create and store your own playlists as well.</p>",

Continuing right after the events of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/27089/god-of-war-ii/\">God of War II</a>, Kratos, the fallen god and spartan warrior, finds himself riding on the back of the Titan Gaia toward Mt. Olympus. Betrayed and killed by his father and ruler of Olympus, Zeus, to give up his power, Kratos returns from the Underworld and decides that he will bring about the death of Zeus by any means necessary. Knowing that the battle against the Olympians would not be easy, he enlists the help of the Titans, the former Elder Gods overthrown by Zeus and his brothers, to help exact revenge. With nothing much to live for, Kratos will stop at nothing to bring chaos to all of Olympus.</p>\n<p><em>God of War III</em> retains much of the same form of gameplay as with the previous titles in the series. In this hack-and-slash action game with platforming and puzzle elements, the player controls the main character Kratos as he battles against many kinds of enemies. Fighting is done by pressing different button combinations which are assigned to certain moves. Finishing off an enemy is done by initiating a QTE (Quick-time Event) when the proper symbol appears above their heads. Kratos also gains some new weapons to go along with the old, including the Cestus and the Blade of Olympus. </p>\n<p>Along with the single player story mode, the game includes various extras and modes. Finishing the game once unlocks the Chaos difficulty and also unlocks an assortment of challenges called the Challenge of Olympus. Also, videos such as \"The Making of God of War III\" and unlockable costumes that grant Kratos special powers can be found in the Treasure section of the game after certain requirements are met.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Guitar Hero II</em>, the follow-up to the PS2-only game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/19812/guitar-hero/\">Guitar Hero</a>, expands upon the gameplay and features of the original game. As a wannabe rockstar, you need to play songs by pressing combinations of five fret buttons on a guitar-shaped controller, while working the strum bar, along with an optional whammy bar for distortion. The sequel contains 64 songs, of which 40 have been licensed. One of the tracks was discovered through a contest at beaguitarhero.com, where unlicensed bands could send in a demo to be included in the game. Most of the tracks have been covered in-studio, but a few use original recordings.</p>\n<p>The career mode has been revamped as a high school battle where you need to make your way to the top. Every venue is now represented by a different city. There are also encore performances, and unlockables can still be bought in the shop. A completely new addition is the practice mode (Shred School). When you keep getting stumped by a single track, you can train in this mode. The background music is dropped, you can choose a certain section to practice, and there four types of speeds available, to slowly get the hang of difficult passages.</p>\n<p>In the multiplayer mode, you can still play the traditional mode from the first game, where sections are traded off between players. The co-op mode is new: both players play the same song at the same time, but one is given the lead guitar, while the other handles the bass or rhythm guitar. Unlike the traditional mode, you can fail and both player share the score, rock meter and multiplier. To activate star power (a short power-up mode where the score multiplier is doubled, built up in a meter by playing a number of star-shaped notes without flaws and best saved for difficult sections) both players need to raise the guitar at the same time. You cannot practice together in this mode, but the different sections are available in the singleplayer practice mode. The final mode is called Face-Off. Here, both players play every single note at the same time. In the multiplayer mode, each player can now choose an individual difficulty level. Upon completing Face-Off, Pro Face-Off becomes available, where both players need to use the same difficulty level.</p>\n<p>Other additions are the introduction of three-button chords, the use of hammer-ons and pull-offs (holding one note while playing another and vice versa) is smoother, and the screen now shakes if you break a note streak (only of the side of the player who makes the mistake in the multiplayer mode).</p>",

        "description": "<p>Long ago, a bird-like race of creatures (called the Chozo) became extremely advanced technologically, but due to increasing violence in the universe, they began to hide and live more simple lives. The planet Tallon IV was the site of one of their colonies. Years later, a meteor crashed on Tallon IV releasing the strange element Phazon into the planet. Phazon poisoned anything it came in contact with, causing the plant and animal life to either die or mutate into a hideous form.</p>\n<p>The Chozo tried to control the power of Phazon but failed. Before abandoning the planet, they were able to cover the impact crater with a temple and seal Phazon into the planet's core. Now space pirates have discovered Tallon IV, moving in to study Phazon and harnessing its power. They have also begun rebuilding their fortress on planet Zebes and reviving the Mother Brain, Ridley, and Kraid, all of whom were destroyed by Samus Aran. However, Samus has tracked the space pirates to Tallon IV and must now enter the planet to destroy them once and for all before they have a chance to rebuild their destructive forces...</p>\n<p><em>Metroid Prime</em> is a change from the platform-adventuring series, entering the first-person shooter genre for the first time. Players are now behind Samus Aran's visor and must use all their resources to investigate the pirate infestation of Tallon IV. Players can use Samus's beam, with missile and charge capabilities. Along the way, they must recover the bounty hunter's lost abilities like the morph ball and grapple beam, which allow them to reach unexplored areas of Tallon IV. Players must piece together the story of the fallen Chozo to figure out what has happened to the poisoned planet and prevent the pirates from using the Phazon to wreak havoc throughout the planets.</p>",

During the campaign the winning condition is to conquer and hold Tokyo; additionally to conquering a certain number of provinces (the exact number changes depending on if the long or short campaign is played). Just like with all entries in the <em>Total War</em> series, the gameplay is split into a turn-based strategy map and real-time tactics fights.</p>\n<p>During the strategy mode the player needs to manage his provinces, e.g. by researching (called \"mastering the arts\") new military and civilian achievements or training special agents like ninjas for assassinations or monks to demoralise the enemy. Each of those units can be improved when they gain experience. Additionally every character can have up to three supporting people who bring further bonuses. Other important factors are trade, diplomacy and the balance between the eight resources. During the campaign the player has not only to take care of the other clans (which will declare war simultaneously if the player is too successful), but also 37 other factions.</p>\n<p>If the player attacks another province or gets attacked, the game switches to real-time combat screen. Here the player needs to use his units cleverly, because ever unit has certain advantages and disadvantages against other units. Besides country combat there are also sieges and sea fights. If the player wants to concentrate on the strategy mode, the battles can be calculated automatically.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</em> once again places the player in control of Link, a Hylian boy who this time around lives in the floating nation of Skyloft. Link is in love with a local girl called Zelda but one day while flying on their bird mounts, a tornado shows up out of nothing and takes Zelda away from Link. After that Link teams up with Fi, a spirit living within a sword and he descends to the long-forgotten surface to search for Zelda.</p>\n<p>The game is structured very similar to previous Zelda games: you travel through an overworld in search of temples to visit and once in you solve a series of puzzles before fighting a boss at the end and receive the next bit of plot. The biggest change is that the overworld is more focused on puzzles this time around with only a handful of action. Also new is the implementation of the Wii Motion Plus which allows full 1:1 controls and new puzzle possibilities. </p>\n<p>The 2021 Nintendo Switch HD version includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhanced Graphics and framerate</li>\n<li>Improved Motion Controls and all-new Button and Stick Control Scheme</li>\n<li>Free Camera Control at certain points of the game</li>\n<li>An intuitive auto-save function, which let the player automatically save when passing an Owl Statue. Instead of manually stopping and saving</li>\n<li>Streamlined opening tutorials and Item descriptions, as well as skippable cutscenes and dialogue (including Fi's interaction with Link).</li>\n<li>Amiibo support, using the new Loftwing amiibo to instantaneously transport Link to The Sky and The Surface and vice-versa.</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p><em>Halo 3</em> is the third game in the main Halo series. Like the rest of the series, it is a sci-fi/military-themed first-person shooter with an emphasis on vehicles and an extensive multiplayer mode in addition to the single-player campaign.</p>\n<p>As before, the series' signature shield system is used where, rather than health, you have a force field of sorts which loses power as you are attacked. You needn't pick up anything to refill it, only take cover for several seconds. If you can avoid being attacked, the shield will recharge on its own.</p>\n<p>Vehicles are again present. These are human and alien transport which can be driven or ridden in with another player or AI doing the driving. Halo 3 adds numerous new types of vehicles, notably a massive mobile command center called the Elephant and a human VTOL aircraft called the Hornet. Enemies with good timing can board a vehicle, kicking out the occupant.</p>\n<p>Also as before, you are limited to one weapon in hand (or one in each hand for some of the smaller guns) and one on back-up with both human and alien weapons available. Weapons can be fired or used to club someone for a melee hit. There are several new weapons, including the gravity hammer, which is a massive hammer for one-hit kills in close combat. When using a single weapon, your second trigger throws grenades, which have a new spike type in addition to the basic sticky and frag ones from previous games. Turrets are back, which are mounted guns with a new missile pod variant and the added ability to rip them off their moorings and carry them around in 3rd person view.</p>\n<p>There is a new feature called equipment where you get objects with particular effects, such as a gravity lift, a shield drain field, a shield recharge field, land mines and a bubble shield which can be penetrated by players, but not gunfire. One piece of equipment can be carried at a time and it can be deployed anywhere.</p>\n<p>All the multiplayer game types from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/15499/halo-2/\">Halo 2</a> are back. This includes the standard fps games like slayer (essentially deathmatch), capture the flag, assault (reverse ctf), territories and king of the hill (territories with a single point). There are also Halo-specific games, like oddball, where you must hold an object the longest time and juggernaut, where one player gets specials powers. Only they can score points. If you kill that player, you become the juggernaut. Two new games are added: VIP, where you are tasked with killing a specific player on the other team and must protect your own VIP, and infection, which is a human team vs a zombie team and humans are infected and brought to the other team as they are killed. There are also dozens of variants of these, such as crazy king, which is king of the hill with a moving hill, mad dash which is a juggernaut games where the object is to get to waypoint instead of kill people and single-weapon versions of slayer. You can make your own custom game types by manipulating a a number of variables such as weapons, goals and player stats.</p>\n<p>This is augmented by Forge, which is a map editor. While it doesn't have the ability to change level geometry, Forge can be used to completely change object placements. This is not only weapons and vehicles and power-ups, but spawn points, crates, fusions coils (exploding barrels), etc. The map editor is actually a playable game mode with some players becoming the monitor and placing objects for use by their teammates. They can give give them a tank, for instance, or create a barrier and levitate it along as mobile cover.</p>\n<p>The campaign mode contains a number of new features as well. The players now control distinct characters in co-op rather than the Chief just having an identical twin, the player limit has been expanded to four and it is now playable online. There is a metagame where you score points in the campaign (used for some of the achievements) and the skulls from <em>Halo 2</em> have been expanded with a checklist and additional features, such as unlocking extra armor for use in multiplayer and additional dialogue featured throughout the game.</p>\n<p>The ability to customize your appearance has been expanded from <em>Halo 2</em> with not only a longer list of emblems to place on your armor and the ability to pick a third color, but multiple armor variants which can be mixed and matched and the ability to use a female voice.</p>\n<p>Other new features include a theater where you can re-watch games you or others played from the viewpoint of any player-character or in third-person or with a free camera. You have the ability to save films for posterity, take screenshots or edit films for highlight reels or machinima (multiplayer only). This is a multiplayer feature, so you can watch films with people in your online party.</p>\n<p>All of these things (edited maps, custom games, films and screenshots) can be put in a new file-sharing feature and are accessible to other players or through any PC via the internet.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Rock Band 2</em> is the sequel to the 2007 musical simulation game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=014633159172\">Rock Band</a> and offers similar gameplay. Directly competing with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/38712/guitar-hero-world-tour/\">Guitar Hero: World Tour</a>, the game allows different people to play together as in a band, with the same peripherals as the first game: lead guitar, bass guitar, microphone and a drum set.</p>\n<p>The new drum and guitar controllers for this version, bundled or sold separately, have been revised and older controllers are also supported. The guitar controller, modelled after the Fender Stratocaster, has five additional fret buttons near the neck, for fast fingertapping sessions. There is also an effect switch to toggle between five different effects. Players use the instruments to match notes on the screen, divided in different portions for different instruments, along with the lyrics for the singer who need to match the pitch.</p>\n<p>The original game's Solo Tour mode and the multiplayer Band World Tour mode have been merged into a single Tour mode where up to four players can cooperate, both local and online (PS3/Xbox 360). Band leaders are no longer necessary and instruments can be swapped at will. From this mode, three options are available: Start Tour (regular tour mode), Tour Challenge (different challenges), and Battle of the Bands (compete against other bands online through score tracking - not on the PS2). The game includes a training mode for the different instruments, as well as a freestyle mode for drummers where they can drum along with custom mp3 files (Xbox 360/PS3). Other modes and modifiers for the regular game modes can be selected from an Extras menu.</p>\n<p>The in-game characters can also be customized and 84 tracks are included on the disc, with many more as downloadable content (not on the PS2). It is also possible to transfer the songs of the first <em>Rock Band</em> (for a price), and downloadable content as well as the two <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Rock+Band%3A+Track+Pack\">track packs</a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>The Beatles: Rock Band</em> is the second released game in the <a href=\"/search/?q=Rock+Band\">Rock Band series</a> to focus on a specific band, following the <a href=\"/search/?q=ac%2Fdc+live+rock+band\">AC/DC Live: Rock Band </a> release.</p>\n<p>The title borrows features from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/39411/rock-band-2/\">Rock Band 2 game</a>, but offers a revamped career mode, with the opportunity to play a story mode going through the different Beatles eras, with specific songs and venues, from The Cavern Club to their rooftop performance on top of Apple Corps' studio. Whilst the game attempts to capture the spirit of significant periods in the band's history some liberties were taken in the presentation; for example Ringo Starr is shown playing the drums on Back in the U.S.S.R. despite not appearing on the actual recording and the studio versions of songs are used in the Live at the Budokan section. Along with the now classic guitar, bass, drums, and vocals parts, the title adds the possibility to have three separate vocals parts, where each singer gets to sing in a different harmony.</p>\n<p>The game features 45 remastered Beatles titles, and further albums will be released, available for purchase through DLCs and exclusive to <em>The Beatles: Rock Band</em>. This is the first time that Apple Corps allowed the Beatles’ music to feature in a video game.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the AC/DC game which looked just like the original Rock Band, the entire game is skinned in a Beatles theme: characters, overall look and feel, sound effects. Skinned instruments were also released. Also still contrary to the AC/DC game, it is not possible to export the songs to play in Rock Band or Rock Band 2.</p>\n<p>The tracklist:</p>\n<p><strong>Singles</strong>* I Want to Hold Your Hand</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I Feel Fine</li>\n<li>Day Tripper</li>\n<li>Paperback Writer</li>\n<li>Revolution</li>\n<li>Don't Let Me Down</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Please Please Me (1963)</strong>* I Saw Her Standing There</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Boys</li>\n<li>Do You Want to Know a Secret</li>\n<li>Twist and Shout</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>With the Beatles (1963)</strong>* I Wanna Be Your Man</p>\n<p><strong>A Hard Day's Night (1964)</strong>* A Hard Day's Night</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can't Buy Me Love</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Beatles For Sale (1964)</strong>* Eight Days a Week</p>\n<p><strong>Help!

        "description": "<p><em>Chinatown Wars</em> puts the player in control of Huang Lee, a member of the Triads in the modern Liberty City. After his father's assassination, Huang flies in from China to deliver a ceremonial sword to his uncle Wu \"Kenny\" Lee to ensure the inheritance of the Triad bosses. However, shortly after his arrival he is jumped, shot, robbed and left for dead, only to survive and vow his vengeance for his father and recover the lost sword to bring honor back to his family.</p>\n<p>While being a mission-based game in the vein of the 3D <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> installments, <em>Chinatown Wars</em> returns to use the more traditional top-down while using a new cel-shaded 3D Engine. Many of the features from the more recent GTA games have been included, such as the safehouse, where the protagonist can read e-mails from other characters in the game and store cars and items. There is also a programmable GPS system that helps players find their way in the Liberty City more easily. A replay feature is also present that allows players to replay previous missions by accessing these through their safehouses. </p>\n<p>While the protagonist can make money by completing missions, he can also engage in drug trading with numerous dealers scattered throughout Liberty City. There are many drugs to choose from including cocaine, heroin, acid, and weed among others; it is possible to buy them cheap and sell them to other dealers by checking their market value through the PDA. From time to time, an e-mail will be sent to the protagonist that will tip him off of dealers that are either selling drugs at a cheap price or buying them at above average market prices. However, the player must also be aware that buying in bulk will attract the attention of the police after the deal has been done, causing the main character's star level to instantly rise. If the protagonist is caught, he will lose all the drugs that he is carrying. </p>\n<p>It is possible to carjack drug vans (which are indicated by a red arrow above them), return them to the safehouse and search them for either drugs or cash. Weapons can be obtained by hijacking Amm-u-nation trucks, but the trucks are heavily-armored and their drivers armed.</p>\n<p>Police chases have been changed in this installment. While it still features a star level, there is also an icon that resembles cop cars. While players can still resort to Pay 'n Spray shops to change the look of the car to throw off the authorities, they can also wreck any pursuing police car, crossing out the car icon. If the cop car icons for that level are dropped, their star level will drop as well.</p>\n<p>The DS version utilizes the system's capabilities such as using the stylus pen as a screwdriver to turn the car's ignition, or taking a plate off in the car and using the stylus to hotwire it. The pen can also be used to scratch off lottery games in stores scattered around in the game, as well as throw explosive devices such as grenades and molotov cocktails or even smash objects such as security panels or a windshield of a car when the player goes into the water while in a vehicle. The microphone can also be used by blowing into it to hail an approaching on-duty taxi. This version also supports Nintendo WFC for statistics uploading to the Rockstar Social Club and multi-play gaming.</p>\n<p>The PSP version adds several new missions, as well as new radio stations. Where the touch screen is used on the DS, the PSP version instead uses the analog stick.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the aftermath of the events of the Third War, Prince Arthas shattered the Frozen Throne and became one with the Lich King. Deep inside the fortress of Icecrown, he then sat on his throne in quiet meditation and the people slowly began to forget the threat that was waiting on the third continent of Azeroth called Northend. But the quiet times are over as the Lich King is now awake again and sends his Scourge armies out to every corner of Azeroth. At the same time the blue Dragon Aspect called Malygos also emerged from his long seclusion and launches a merciless war against mortal practitioners of arcane magic. Now both the Horde and the Alliance amass their armies and make their move into Northend in the hopes of keeping the threat in check and perhaps even finally destroy it.</p>\n<p>Besides the whole new continent of Northrend with new zones, enemies, factions, instances and hundreds of quests, the second add-on to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/15620/world-of-warcraft/\">World of Warcraft</a> also adds the first hero class to the game: the Death Knight. A Death Knight can be created on every server the player already has a level 55+ character on, can be of any race and is very powerful because he can do almost everything except for carrying shields or using ranged weapons. Once the player has created a Death Knight, he begins his life at level 55 in an instanced area on a necrophyle under the watchful eye of the Lich King himself. During the following quest line, the player will not only learn how to enchant his sword by using runecrafting, he will also slowly become disgusted with the ways of the Lich King and in the end desert him to enter the normal world of Azeroth and Outland and join up with the Alliance or Horde in the fight against the Lich King.</p>\n<p>The expansion also expands the level cap to 80. In correspondence with that new talents are available for each class to invest the 10 additional points in and many trees were rebalanced to accompany the new talents. Another addition is the new profession called \"Inscription\". People of that profession can produce Glyphs that are not applied to an item but instead alter the effects and/or requirements of spells and abilities of their carrier. A druid can for example use a glyph to increase the duration of his \"Thorns\"-buff from 10 minutes to 60 minutes or decrease the amount of mana required to cast \"Gift of the Wild\".</p>\n<p>Other new features are new pvp battlegrounds and arenas, the addition of Barbershops, which allow the players to change their appearance after character creation in exchange for gold, an Achievements-system and an in-game calendar.</p>",

The game takes place on Helghan, the home-world of the Helghast who assaulted the Interplanetary Strategic Alliance's colony on Vekta. The ISA retaliates on the Helghan's own ground with the aim to secure the Helghast leader, Emperor Visari, and bring the Helghast war machine to a halt. Assuming the role of Sergeant Tomas \"Sev\" Sevchenko, a battle-hardened veteran and a member of the special forces unit known as the Legion. Under his command, players lead a group of highly trained soldiers on a mission to take out the Helghast threat.</p>\n<p>The gameplay consists of what the developers describe as Hollywood Realism, focusing on scripted, cinematic gameplay. The game is played entirely from the first-person perspective, except for the portions with vehicular combat with a tank and an exoskeleton. A large portion is dedicated to seeking cover and peeking from behind objects to open fire. Next to the single-player campaign, there is squad-based multiplayer called Warzone with five different kinds of missions (Assassination, Search &amp; Retrieve, Search &amp; Destroy, Bodycount and Capture &amp; Hold) based on seven kinds of classes. There is support for up to 32 players, with the addition of bots to fill the remaining spots.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Victory looks different. Yes, the United Earth Directorate is no more and the Overmind has finally been destroyed. The Terran world Tarsonis now lies in ruins, as does the Protoss homeworld of Aiur. The Queen of Blades, formerly known as Sarah Kerrigan, is still out there and Arcturus Mengsk's administration turns out to be even more dangerous than the Confederacy. No wonder that four years after the events of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1421/starcraft-brood-war/\">StarCraft: Brood War</a>, Jim Raynor is trying to drown his sorrows with booze while helping the rebels on Mar Sara in the fight against Mengsk's Dominion.\nThe trot changes, however, when one day Tychus Findley, imprisoned for life by the Dominion, shows up proposing a deal. Soon after that, Backwater Station is overrun by the Zerg, who are now the dominant species in the Koprulu Sector, revealing an invasion of the Terran systems. So, Raynor retreats to his flagship, the battlecruiser Hyperion, and once again enters the fight for survival - and the search for his beloved Kerrigan.</p>\n<p><em>StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty</em> is the first part in the <em>StarCraft II</em> trilogy. As such, most of the 29 missions of the single-player campaign have the player fight on the Terran side. There are, however, a few missions where the Protoss Zeratul gets to tell parts of his side of the story, with the player controlling him and his Protoss friends. Most of the missions feature different and changing objectives but are, at their core, all about real-time strategy, with the player more often than not having to build up his base from scratch, collect the two resources, produce and upgrade an army and fight the usual suspects: other Terrans, Zerg, and Protoss. The gameplay is pretty straightforward RTS, using a rock-paper-scissors system in combat between the three very different races, with each unit vulnerable to several other units and vice versa.</p>\n<p>As the campaign progresses, the player automatically gains access to new units, which he can then upgrade in the Armory of the Hyperion in exchange for money, also earned throughout the missions. Each unit and some of the buildings can be upgraded two times, unlocking new abilities for the unit. The stimpack for the Marines, for example, which allows them to do more damage for a short amount of time at the expense of some health.\nIn addition, there's the Laboratory on the Hyperion. Here, the scientists research Zerg and Protoss DNA, which the player collects during missions by fulfilling bonus objectives. These range from simply gathering samples from dead Zerg to killing a hulking Brutalisk. After each five tiers of the DNA double helix, the player can choose between two possible upgrades in each research tree, allowing him, for example, to either automate the collection of Vespine Gas or build two SCVs at once. Once both research trees have been completed, each additional DNA artifact is sold for a sum of credits.</p>\n<p>The third deck on the Hyperion is the bridge. Here, the player chooses one from up to three missions as his next assignment, has the ability to replay both the in-game cutscenes and the rendered sequences, and replay old missions, e.g. on a higher difficulty level to earn additional achievements or to discover the consequences of different choices as the branching plot unfolds.</p>\n<p>The fourth deck is the Cantina. Here, the player can look at trophies earned for completing a story strand (e.g. all missions given by Tychus), watch the news, hire mercenaries (who will then become available in all upcoming missions in exchange for resources) or play a round of \"The Lost Viking\". The latter is a full-blown vertical-scrolling shooter like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/511/raptor-call-of-the-shadows/\">Raptor: Call of the Shadows</a>, built with the included Starcraft Galaxy Editor and featuring many elements of the main game.</p>\n<p><em>StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty</em> also offers an extensive multiplayer mode which differs greatly from the single-player experience. The player can play as any of the three races but the available units differ in part from the ones available to him in the campaign. The Terran Medic, for example, has been cut - only the flying Medivac can be built. Nine challenges are available to test the abilities of the player to e.g. know which units are best against others or how to survive the infamous Zerg rush.\nIn addition, after entering the multiplayer, the player has to play several practice rounds during which the game judges his skill and throws him in one of the five leagues (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond) and activates the match-making feature. Here, or in custom games, he can fight against up to eight players on 61 maps, some of which are specially made beginner's versions of other maps to prevent early rushes. The maps are divided into several categories based on gameplay type, like coop, simple free-for-all or team matches, and the number of players; eight being the largest number of players a map can hold. Bots are available to fill up open slots and additional achievements are waiting to be earned in order to unlock new avatar pictures or troop banners.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Rock Band</em>, by the original developers behind the <a href=\"/search/?q=Guitar+Hero\">Guitar Hero</a> games, takes the concept a step further. Instead of solely playing the guitar along with songs, this game allows players to start a full virtual band with up to four players, with different sequences for each of the three supported peripherals: guitar (electric and bass), drum and microphone. Gameplay is based on hitting scrolling notes on the screen in time (scrolling vertically for drum and guitar), and getting the right pitch for the vocals (scrolling horizontally at the top of the screen, along with the lyrics).</p>\n<p>The game offers a Solo Tour Mode for a single player or a Band World Tour (as well as Quick Play) for two to four players. By doing well players earn cash to customize the characters in the Rock Shop, with tattoos, face paint, clothing and logos. Customized characters are automatically locked to an instrument. Other customizations include movements on stage, instruments, and the general physique and appearance in the game. To succeed, players need to reach a set score through their combined performances. Multipliers for playing perfectly are tracked for the individual instruments and there can also be separate difficulty levels. The Star Power from the Guitar Hero series has been replaced by Overdrive, a meter filled by not making any mistakes in certain sections of a song. In band play using Overdrive also increases the band's score multiplier.</p>\n<p>Players who fail during the song are locked out and the audio mix takes over. Other band members can revive the player by using their Overdrive. Failed players will however drag down the band's overall performance, so it becomes important to bring back band members. Next to the Overdrive sections, there are also Union Phrases (score bonus and extra Overdrive) and sometimes Big Rock Endings at the end of a song where another bonus can be gained.</p>\n<p>In the Tour Mode players visit 41 venues in seventeen different cities. After the initial venues, others need a certain numbers of fans to be unlocked and certain continents only become available when tour buses or private jets are acquired. Not every venue comes with a set list of tracks. They consists of single tracks, multiple tracks, custom setlists or mystery setlists. Performing poorly can also have the band lose fans. Extra competition is included to attract managers, roadies and deals with record labels. </p>\n<p>Next to the main modes there is also a versus mode for the individual instruments (Tug of War), Score Duel (get the most points) and a Tutorial mode. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions feature multiplayer games with new songs through downloadable content.</p>\n<p>The European version is not sold as a single package. Instead, there is an instruments package and the game is sold separately, for a much higher price than the original US release.</p>",

Mario starts a point in each level which he must traverse to reach a flagpole at the end.</p>\n<p>The levels are populated by many of the series' mainstays such as Goombas, Koopa Troopas, Cheep Cheeps, etc. who will try to attack Mario. When he is attacked, he will lose his current power-up or shrink down to a small size if he hasn't already, in which case he will lose a life and must retry the level. If this happens multiple times, the player can activate the White Tanooki suit to grant Mario invincibility for that level.</p>\n<p>He can grow back to normal size again by collecting a mushroom. Some of the power-ups Mario can use to aid him include the Tanooki suit, which allows him to hover in the air while jumping and use a spinning attack, and the Flower Suit, which allows him once again to shoot fireballs in the direction he is facing.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>ESPN NFL 2K5</em> has a ton of new features for the new season.</p>\n<p>To start off, the ESPN presentation has been greatly expanded. Chris Berman, who did voiceover for the half-time show in 2K4, returns for this season. Instead of just voice, there is a virtual Chris Berman, who does an introduction to each game, a half-time report, and a post-game show. To illiustrate certain points, he uses replays from each game. Every move you pull off of every quarter of every game is saved and used in these replays (Xbox only). Suzy Kobler gives reports from the sideline.</p>\n<p>One new feature is the V.I.P. system, which keeps track of how you play the game. If you pass 80% of the time, and run 20% of the time, your V.I.P. profile will reflect this. At a later time, you can play against your V.I.P., and the AI will play as if it were you.</p>\n<p>ESPN celebrates it's 25th anniversary this year, and as such, a special 25th Anniversary Mode has been added. This mode allows you to play moments from classic football games, including The Heidi Bowl and The Immaculate Reception.</p>\n<p>The Crib has an overhaul this year. Instead of earning specific items by completing tasks, you earn points, which you can use to buy items of your choice. New to the Crib is a dart board, as well as a phone, which you will use to answer calls from celebrities. You may get a call from Steve-O, Carmen Electra, Jamie Kennedy, David Arquette or Funkmaster Flex, challenging you to a game.</p>\n<p>Franchise mode also gets an overhaul. New to 2005 is the ability to schedule weekly preps for your team. You can choose to have players work out, play practice games, watch tapes, all in an effort to gear your team up for the next game.</p>\n<p>ESPN NFL 2K5 can be played over Xbox Live, with future support for leagues. The game is also \"always connected\", as long as you have an internet connection. This allows it to keep buddy lists up to date, see friends, receive requests, all the time, whether you're actually playing an online game or not. Roster updates will be available in the future.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Saren and the Sovereign have been defeated and the Citadel has been saved. Depending on the player's choices made in <a href=\"/search/?q=mass+effect\">the first Mass Effect</a>, humanity may be all that's left of the Citadel Council. Of course, that doesn't keep them from ignoring the former war-hero Shepard who knows that the threat from the Reapers is still real. Instead, they send him or her on a boring mission to find some Geth in the Terminus system. The inevitable happens: a new enemy enters the scene, destroys Shepard's ship, the Normandy, and kills the hero of the galaxy. End of game?</p>\n<p>No, not really. Cerberus, a known right-wing network, believes the threat from the Reapers to be real and only sees one chance of saving the human race: Shepard. So they invest millions upon millions of credits into the Lazarus Project, and two years after Shepard died floating in space, he (she) reawakens on-board the Cerberus Station. The main mission is given by Cerberus: find out more about the mysterious race of Collectors who abduct millions of human colonists for an unknown purpose, and figure out their possible connection to the Reapers.</p>\n<p><em>Mass Effect 2</em> is a hybrid of third-person-shooter and role-playing game. After the prologue, where the player witnesses the destruction of the original Normandy, he has to create a new character and choose from one of six classes each with its own powers. The decision also influences which weapons the player can use during playthrough as only the soldier can wield every weapon in the game. During the course of the game, the player and his squad-mates earn experience points by killing enemies, fulfilling missions, and hacking safes in order to get a level up. For each level up between 1-20, two talent points are awarded, from 21 to the maximum level of 30 only one, with which the character's powers can be upgraded in four stages. Once the last upgrade has been purchased, a specialization has to be chosen making the talent even more powerful in one aspect. All this goes also for the player squadmates. The player starts with two companions at his side but can collect up to ten during the course of the game. While he is only allowed to bring two with him into a mission, the collected experience points will be equally shared with those that are left behind.</p>\n<p>Fighting is done in a <a href=\"/search/?q=Gears+of+War\">Gears of War</a>-like fashion, with the characters being able to storm into cover and look out to get in a few shots. In addition, health and shield energy are regenerated automatically if the protagonist or his squadmates avoid being hit for a few seconds. To fight the various kinds of enemies, each class has access to different types of weapons like the sniper rifle and heavy pistol for the infiltrator as well as five different kinds of heavy weapons. The weapons now require ammunition which is either dropped by killed enemies or scattered around the level, but there are only two types: one for the heavy weapons and one for all others. Heavy weapons like the grenade launcher come with a very limited supply of ammunition but are very powerful even against full-blown mechs.</p>\n<p>Inventory management has been removed entirely. The player is only able to change the weapons load-out of his team from the small set he will collect during the course of the game. His squadmates don't have different armor anymore, only the protagonist's appearance can be changed by researching new armor parts and putting them together to a full suit in his cabin aboard the Normandy. Through research, the player also gets access to upgrades to the Normandy, his squadmates, and their tools. To do research the player not only needs to find or buy the plans for the upgrade but also needs enough minerals. The four types of minerals in the game are either found in chests during a mission or collected through a scanning mini-game on the galaxy map. In the mini-game, the player uses a cursor to move around the face of the planet and send in probes if he finds a mineral source. Side quests can also be found this way and are shown as anomalies on a planet.</p>\n<p>Besides the combat, the second most important part of the game are the multiple-choice dialogues. The decisions the player makes here heavily influence the player's path deciding if he will become a bad or a good person. To that end not only the dialogue choices are sorted by good, neutral and bad but special dialogue options are available for each path if the player has enough points in it that can end a dialogue prematurely in the hero's favor. Quick-time events have been introduced, where the player can perform an alignment action independent from his current path, such as hitting an obnoxious reporter in the face to shut her up.</p>\n<p>As opposed to the first game, the PC- and the Xbox-360-versions are nearly identical. The only difference is the interface which, on the Xbox 360, features a radial menu with the ability to put four powers on hot-keys as opposed to the PC-version which features a mouse-controlled drag-&amp;-drop interface and a quick-slot ribbon for up to eight powers to be activated by using the number keys. On both platforms, the player can directly use the powers his squadmates possess.</p>\n<p>One of the most important features of <em>Mass Effect 2</em> is the ability to import a character from the first game. While the character itself including class and appearance can still be changed at the beginning of the game, he will get a huge bonus both in credits, experience points, and minerals at the start of the game depending on the character level he had at the end. In addition, hundreds of decisions the player made in the first game will have an impact on more or less important parts of <em>Mass Effect 2</em>. This includes the state of the universe at the beginning of the game, which romances the player pursued and which of his squadmates died or survived the end as well as minor decisions like the survival of the Rachni queen. If Shepard survives the end of <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, the player will be able to carry him over to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/55078/mass-effect-3/\">Mass Effect 3</a>, too.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Drake's Deception</em> is the third main game in the <em>Uncharted</em> series. A couple of years have passed for Nathan Drake, an <a href=\"/search/?q=Indiana+Jones\">Indiana Jones</a>-like adventurer with a knack to find himself in all kinds of trouble. As usual, he always pulls his loyal friend and companion Sully along with him. The story takes the player back to Nathan's youth and how he met Sully when they were both after a ring and then returns to modern times. The game immediately introduces a whole new gameplay element that focuses on melee combat that consists of kicking and evading enemy hits, and a combination of both which may result in certain special moves during which Nate can also interact with surrounding objects for finishers. Quick time events are also used in melee combat to break free or to evade incoming attacks.</p>\n<p>The story eventually builds up to a search for the legendary lost city Iram which takes the player through various different locations and environments, from the dark streets of England to a hidden castle in France, a monastery in Syria, and Rub' al Khali, one of the largest deserts in the world. Gameplay is very similar to the previous two games, with many contextual moves and the newly added melee art of fighting while not carrying a weapon. A large part is still spent climbing, using acrobatic movement, and shooting opponents with two types of weapons that can be exchanged with those of dead enemies. The cinematics are much more seamless with the actual gameplay. There is also a slight focus on stealth now, encouraging the player to use cover and stealth skills to avoid large battles. True to the series, there are many optional artifacts lying around to collect during the adventure, which results in trophy awards. At certain moments larger puzzles need to be solved by manipulating items in the environment and consulting clues in Drake's notebook. When the player gets stuck for too long, hints are shown gradually and automatically.</p>\n<p>Aside from the story campaign which is split into 22 chapters, the game comes with cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes.</p>\n<p>Unlike in the original PS3 release, the PS4 release features only the single-player mode, not the multiplayer mode. However, the PS4 release features a photo mode where you can pause the game and make the current screen look like a photo.</p>",

        "description": "<p>After having defeated Mother Brain, the leader of the Space Pirates who wanted to use alien creatures known as Metroids to dominate the world, the bounty hunter Samus Aran took the fight to the Metroids' homeland and eradicated them. Only a single Metroid larva remained. Samus took it to a galactic research station, and scientists assured her that the powers of the larva can be harnessed to help people. However, everything goes wrong when a dragon kills the scientists, takes away the larva, and destroys the research facility. Samus follows the dragon to the planet of Zebes, where she fought Mother Brain before. She must explore the dangerous planet, stay alive, and figure out a way to retrieve the larva.</p>\n<p><em>Super Metroid</em> is a platform game and a follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4282/metroid-ii-return-of-samus/\">Metroid II</a>. Like the previous games in the series, it is not divided into separate levels; the planet Zebes is an open world which Samus traverses back and forth. This world is divided into rooms separated by doors which must be shot to be opened. Shooting is also used to open up secret passages, some of which contain nifty bonuses, but finding most of them is required to proceed in the game. </p>\n<p>There are many items to find on the way, and each new item usually makes heretofore inaccessible areas available to Samus. The items include both weaponry (such as missiles, super missiles, or upgrades to Samus's standard laser gun), energy tanks that increase Samus' max health, and other gadgets (like a grappling hook that allows Samus to stick to the ceiling). </p>\n<p>There are various enemies - alien fauna - lurking around planet Zebes. The enemies all respawn after re-entering a room, though Samus' increasing capabilities mean that they become easier to defeat as the player makes progress. After killing them, the enemies typically leave behind some health or ammo.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Gears of War 3</em> takes place 18 months after the end of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/38697/gears-of-war-2/\">second game</a>, and picks up on the on-going story from the <em>Gears of War</em> books, the last one being <em>Coalition's End</em>.</p>\n<p>After sinking Jacinto in order to flood the Locust Hordes' subterranean homeland, the Coalition of Ordered Governments (COG) was forced to relocate their entire population to their former island stronghold and navy base on Vectes via Port Farrell. The growing threat from the emerging Lambent, however, has now forced the COG to abandon Vectes Island as well. As a result, the COG has been disbanded, and its population split up into smaller communities to avoid drawing attention from the Lambent. The player will once again assume the role of Sergeant Marcus Fenix, leader of Delta Squad, currently aboard the flotilla of ships housing the survivors as they deal with the relocation and fight off the lambent threat.</p>\n<p><em>Gears 3</em> retains the shooter gameplay used in previous games, using over-the-shoulder third person system, as well as a cover system that allows players to move from cover point to cover point, roll and blind fire weapons/lob grenades. Players are now able to knock down opponents as a result of vaulting over short cover points. Players can also do a 'roadie run', which is essentially a sprint, except in a crouched stance to reduce profile. Also making a reappearance is the active reload, which speeds up reloading if the player hits reload again quickly enough, or a damage boost and a quick reload if the player times it to perfection.</p>\n<p>New to the <a href=\"/search/?q=Gears+of+War\">Gears</a> series is the ability to play with four other player's over Xbox Live, with the three other players taking on the role of Delta Squad. <em>Gears of War 2</em>'s five player co-op Horde Mode also gets a revamp to <em>Horde Mode 2.0</em>. Also included is the new <em>Beast Mode</em>, the opposite of <em>Horde</em>, in which players fill the shoes of a member of the Locust Horde attempting to survive wave after wave of COG soldiers. In addition to these, all previous multiplayer game modes return.</p>",

While <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5289/sid-meiers-civilization-iii/\">Sid Meier's Civilization III</a> put cultural influence in the forefront, this time it is religion that is put forward as a new factor underlying many aspects of the game.</p>\n<p>In addition, <em>Sid Meier's Civilization IV</em> attempts to streamline gameplay by removing some features (corruption, pollution) which slowed down the late stages of the game and making significant changes to the combat system so that tactical thinking plays a more important role. Units now have a single combat value instead of defense and attack values, have a special ability and can be further enhanced with experience in a player-defined way.</p>\n<p>The game also offers some aesthetic improvements such as a detailed 3D map, environmental ambiance and animated units.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the third and final outing of the Metroid Prime series, bounty hunter Samus Aran is contacted by the Galactic Federation to discover why a computer network, known as the \"Aurora Unit\", has started to malfunction. The Federation believes it is the work of their long-time nemesis, the Space Pirates, and dispatches Samus to investigate the situation. </p>\n<p><em>Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</em> is a first-person action game that spans the course of several planets. Along the way, Samus meets with Federation members and other bounty hunters. Samus also runs into many old foes; one such foe, Dark Samus, corrupts her with Phazon energy that increases her powers via a PED (Phazon Enhancement Device). She can choose when to use this energy, but the Phazon will kill her if used for longer than a certain time period. </p>\n<p>Gameplay is set within several 3D worlds, following the traditional Metroid formula of finding various armor and weapon upgrades to use, exploring areas, fighting numerous bosses, and avoiding environmental dangers. Although the game contains several action-heavy sequences involving firepower, the game's main focus stays with using new items at various locations to discover previously unexplored areas.</p>\n<p>The play control has been reworked to take advantage of the Wii's capabilities. For instance, players point the Wii Remote to aim Samus's arm cannon. The Nunchuk accessory is used for grappling objects; this grapple ability can be used to pull obstacles out of the way, grab an enemy's shield from its grip, or to swing across a gap. Samus can also use the Morph Ball to roll through small spaces or to escape enemies; Samus can even jump while in Morph Ball form without using bombs. Additionally, Samus can call her gunship to assist in battles, travel to other planets, or provide a mobile save point.</p>\n<p>Also new to the series are a collection of \"Achievements\", which can be unlocked by performing various tasks, such as killing a certain number of enemies, or scanning certain objects. The Achievements can also be shared with friends via WiiConnect24, by posting photos, or unlocking other special bonuses.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>God of War</em> is set in the age of ancient Greek myths. The hero of the game is a mortal warrior Kratos. Long time ago, Kratos was the leader of Spartans, a fearless and brutal general who waged wars for the glory of his city. Today, he is known as the Ghost of Sparta. For the past ten years, he is tormented with terrible nightmares, unable to forget the tragedy that happened in his past. He has to serve the gods of Olympus, who promised to forgive his sins if he becomes their champion. Finally, the goddess Athene tells Kratos that redemption will be granted to him if he defeats her brother, the god of war Ares, who was the very reason for the tragic event of his past...</p>\n<p><em>God of War</em> is a 3D action game with platforming and puzzle-solving elements. Kratos has two default swords that he will always carry with him, called the Blades of Chaos. They allow the player to perform combos, which will constantly climb until the fight is over or until it takes too long to register another hit. The higher the combo total, the more red orbs Kratos receives from defeated enemies.</p>\n<p>Similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5086/devil-may-cry/\">Devil May Cry</a>, the red orbs collected from fallen enemies can be used to purchase upgrades. It is possible to upgrade the default weapons, learning new moves and striking faster, or put the orbs into different weapons acquired throughout the game, such as Blade of Artemis. Kratos will, over time, also have access to a selection of magic spells. At specific points in the game, he will be able to generate an arc of electricity, courtesy of Zeus, or use the decapitated head of a Gorgon to turn enemies into stone with Meduza's Gaze.</p>\n<p>The game features several unlockable extras, which are only acquired when the player has beaten the game on different difficulty modes. Most of the features are a behind-the-scenes look at various aspects of the game, such as creating the world, modeling Kratos, and a look at deleted levels that didn't make the final cut of the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Street Fighter IV</em> is the first main game in the fighting series, since the release of <em>Street Fighter III</em> in 1997, to up the main number in the game title. Produced by <a href=\"/search/?q=Yoshinori+Ono\">Yoshinori Ono</a>, the game was launched following the positive response to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/23379/street-fighter-ii-hyper-fighting/\">Street Fighter II': Hyper Fighting</a>.</p>\n<p>The game is chronologically set between the second and third main series and features a cast of well-known characters. The most important change is the visual style. Instead of choosing full 3D like the <a href=\"/search/?q=Tekken\">Tekken</a> or <a href=\"/search/?q=Virtua+Fighter\">Virtua Fighter</a> series, <em>SF IV</em> stays true to it roots with stages on 2D planes. The characters are rendered in 3D with polygons similar to the <a href=\"/search/?q=Street+Fighter+EX\">Street Fighter EX</a> series, but now with a hand-drawn touch of strokes and smudges, providing an effect of ink or paint in the visual design.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is largely reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1159/super-street-fighter-ii-turbo/\">Super Street Fighter II Turbo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5051/street-fighter-iii-3rd-strike/\">Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike</a> with a six-button scheme for light, medium and heavy kicks and punches, throws, dashes, quick standing, combos and special moves. New to this game are Focus Attacks (Saving Systems in the Japanese version), based on two stances where an incoming attack can be absorbed and consequently countered. These attacks can be used to cancel out special moves, leading to new opportunities for combos and putting the emphasis into reading an opponent's move, rather than relying on strict combos. Regular special moves can be powered up through a super combo gauge. There is also a revenge gauge that is filled up by taking damage. When full, an ultra combo can be performed, with a long cinematic set of moves, often shown from a camera perspective that breaks away from the regular view.</p>\n<p>Compared to the arcade version, the home version offers online multiplayer, new characters, both Japanese and English voice acting, animated introductions and endings for all characters, bonus stages, a new introduction, a challenge mode that introduces players to the basics, and downloadable content.</p>\n<p>The set of playable characters includes:* Abel (new)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Akuma</li>\n<li>Balrog</li>\n<li>Blanka</li>\n<li>Cammy</li>\n<li>Chun-Li</li>\n<li>Crimson Viper (new)</li>\n<li>Dan</li>\n<li>Dhalsim</li>\n<li>E. Honda</li>\n<li>El Fuerte (new)</li>\n<li>Fei-Long</li>\n<li>Gen</li>\n<li>Guile</li>\n<li>Ken</li>\n<li>M. Bison</li>\n<li>Rose</li>\n<li>Rufus (new)</li>\n<li>Ryu</li>\n<li>Sagat</li>\n<li>Sakura</li>\n<li>Vega</li>\n<li>Zangief</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other characters are Gouken, Ryu and Ken's sensei and the elder brother of Akuma, as a computer-controlled character, and Seth as the new boss character.</p>",

The game is an open-ended one and there is no official ending. The content changes often as it being updated regularly based on player feedback.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Set one year after <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9237/castlevania-aria-of-sorrow/\">Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</a>, the first <em>Castlevania</em> game for the DS has you playing Soma Cruz again. While attempting to return to a normal life Soma is attacked by the leader of a cult with the intention of reviving Count Dracula. He, as well as friends from his last adventure, are drawn to the cult's headquarters to prevent another age of darkness.</p>\n<p>All the action takes place on the lower screen, while the top screen is used to see the map or your character's stats. Soma can still equip various kinds of weapons, armor, and monster souls, although the exact powers of the souls have changed slightly from the previous game. Instead of multiples of the same soul just taking up space they are now necessary, as many abilities will not reach their full power unless Soma possesses nine duplicates of the soul. Yoko Belnades has set up an enchanting store inside the castle, allowing Soma to merge souls with weapons in his possession to forge more powerful weapons. The game also takes advantage of the touch screen feature to let you draw magic runes to perform powerful moves to defeat evil monsters.</p>\n<p>For the first time in a <em>Castlevania</em> game simultaneous multiplayer modes are possible. Place monsters in a series of rooms and then blaze through it with a friend over wireless connection, either competitively or cooperatively. Trading extra souls between carts is also possible over wireless communication.</p>\n<p>The mobile version is a fairly genuine port of the original game with a few minor differences. It adds a new special rare item: the lost soul vial. This item can be used if Soma dies and resurrects him. There is also the bat altar which can be used when Soma owns the bat form ability. Soma walks on a bat altar with the bat ability and is teleported to the linked bat altar. The inventory is strictly limited to weapons, armors and magic spells. It is not possible to store food, life potions or other items.</p>",

        "description": "<p>'Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan' is a music-based rhythm game on the Nintendo DS. The premise revolves around a troupe of men dressed in black uniforms that act as a \"Cheersquad\" (or 'Ouendan'). Their job: Aid anyone who is in need of motivation whenever they cry out \"OUENDAN!!!\" When the cry is heard, these guys appear and dance to music in order to motivate the person to finish his or her task. </p>\n<p>The Cheersquad's success depends on how well the player does. The game takes advantage of the system's touch screen by having players tap circles in time with the beat of the music. Other actions include tapping a stack of circles repeatedly, following a moving ball along a path by dragging the stylus on it, and spinning a wheel. Each successful action fills a power bar at the top of the touch screen and contributes to the score. This bar drains continuously and will take large hits if the player misses a beat or two. If the bar hits zero, the game is over.  </p>\n<p>Ouendan contains 15 licensed songs with a level dedicated to each, and the songs are drawn from popular Japanese Rock. There are also 4 difficulty levels, 2 of which have to be unlocked through play. Each difficulty level alters the number of circles that need to be tapped, paths to trace, and wheels to spin. The timing of each is also changed, with easier difficulties giving more time to anticipate when to tap, while harder difficulties speed this up. A multiplayer mode is also featured, as well as a download &amp; play option that sends the tutorial level to DS's that don't have the game.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Geralt of Rivia saved King Foltest from an unknown assassin at the end of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/30752/the-witcher/\">first game</a>. One month later, he is locked in the dungeons pending execution for a crime he didn't commit. Somehow he must convince his jailers of his innocence and be allowed to hunt down the real Kingslayer. Teaming up with a high-ranking official of Temeria, Geralt conducts his own investigation and is shocked to discover that the mysterious killer is, in all probability, a witcher just like himself.</p>\n<p><em>The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</em> is a single-person role-playing game in which the player takes control of Geralt the Witcher in third-person view. The fantasy world of the game is dark, and so are its evils - murder, kidnapping, torture, racism, rape, corruption and prostitution. Politics are complex, and decisions made by those in power can cause kingdoms to fall at any moment. There are monsters that stalk through the sewers and streets, forests and hills, caves and crypts. As one of the few remaining witchers, Geralt's skills are sought by many, and he will face more than atypical foes, each with its own attack methods, strengths and weaknesses. Quests can be solved in different ways, and ethical decisions made will effect which one of the sixteen different endings the player receives. </p>\n<p>Geralt fights alone using steel and silver swords with the aid of his magical Signs. Additional tactics are possible with thrown weapons (daggers and bombs) or by placing traps in strategic locations. Time of the day as well as the weather can influence the effectiveness of Geralt's combat techniques. The game abandons the timed combo-based battle system of its predecessor, following a simpler action combat style, including light and strong attacks, blocking, parrying, and dodging. The sequel introduces more types of weapons and heavier armor management. Four difficulty modes are available at the start of a new game (Easy, Normal, Hard or Insane) but can be changed within the game.</p>\n<p>Collecting components and reagents is necessary for the alchemy and crafting elements of the game. Pilfering items is unhindered since any chest, barrel or furnishings can be searched without repercussions. Geralt must have the appropriate diagram or formula in inventory to concoct potions and bombs, or to have an item crafted by a merchant. Some weapons contain expansion slots for the addition of magical runes. Armor can be improved with type-specific enhancements. Once endowed, the rune or addition is permanent.</p>\n<p>Quick Time Events may appear from time to time and are handled differently depending upon the activity. During fist fights, for instance, the player must press specific keyboard keys quickly as they appear on the screen. In arm wrestling and during certain scenario-specific events, a mouse button must be pressed rapidly or held down when prompted to do so.

In the game the player must fend off contesting Spaniards and indigenous Martian lifeforms in order to regain the favor of the British monarch.</p>\n<p>The player starts with a single ship, but can unlock three more at an in-game shop. Each weapon has a different primary and secondary fire mode and universal \"Vaunt mode\", when Vaunt is activated the ship gains invulnerability through a shield for a couple seconds and then as long as the player keeps the ship's Vaunt meter for fully draining a multiplier for all scores gained. Money is earned by playing levels, the more points the player receives during a level, the more money is gained. The player can replay levels whenever he or she wants to earn additional money.</p>\n<p>To progress in the story mode the player is at certain points forced to finish previous levels at a certain difficulty to advance. Aside from the story missions there are also 20 challenge missions which reuse enemies and backgrounds from the story missions but have specific challenging goals such as to survive for 5 seconds or gain a certain amount of points.</p>\n<p>The game hovers in between conventional side-scrolling shooters and the \"bullet hell\", alternating between the two styles of play during levels. The game supports local 4 player cooperative multiplayer.</p>",

Through the game you’ll encounter all kinds of mechanical and biomechanical creatures. Shatterhand’s primary weapon is his cybernetic fists and therefore most enemies must be defeated by punching them.</p>\n<p>Additional help can be given from any of the eight hovering satellite robots, each of which has it’s own weapon that fires automatically when Shatterhand throws a punch. These satellite robots can be obtained by collecting combinations of alpha-beta letters that appear when you punch some of the white boxes that are scattered throughout each stage.</p>\n<p>The game has seven stages. The first and the last must be played first and last respectively, but the five middle stages can be played in any order. The path to the final showdown with General Grover leads through a factory, a refinery, an anti-gravity research facility, a submarine, a burning subway, a filtration plant and finally to General Grover’s missile launch complex.</p>",

If you mentally change the driver names, it can be thought of as a recreation of real NASCAR racing rather than a direct recreation of the film. </p>\n<p>You play Cruise's Cole Trickle character (his name, like many of the others, is slightly different to that of a real NASCAR racer of the day) against your rivals on 8 tracks, based on real-life counterparts. The races are all on ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are varied.  This means that the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another. Qualifying is incorporated alongside the races themselves.</p>\n<p>From times to times you'll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you lose positions at the race. The other racers, however, never pit.</p>\n<p>The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only.</p>",

Among the countries of this world, the most powerful one is the Empire of Valua. Guided by its greedy admirals, Valua strives to possess all the power in Arcadia. The boy Vyse and the girl Aika are members of the Blue Rogues - noble pirates who attack only Valuan warships. During one of their confrontations with a battleship, they encounter a girl named Fina, who is on an important mission whose secret she cannot tell yet. Involved in the conflict with the Empire of Valua, the trio of the heroes must explore the whole world of Arcadia in order to defeat the admirals.</p>\n<p><em>Skies of Arcadia</em> is a traditional Japanese role-playing game with turn-based combat and randomly appearing enemies. Player-controlled party contains up to four active combatants. During battles, characters attack physically, use items, or cast magic spells, which deplete magic points as well as spirit points (SP). Each character is also able to \"focus\", which restores spirit points. Once the common spirit bar is filled, characters can unleash powerful special attacks. Enemies may be resilient or vulnerable to particular elements; elemental affinities of weapons can be switched at any time during battles.</p>\n<p>Besides the usual party-based combat, there are also airship battles in the game. These usually occur at specific plot points and involve the player-controlled airship fighting another ship or a giant creature. These battles are round-based, with the player planning several turns ahead, using various kinds of ship weapons (cannons, torpedoes, etc.). </p>\n<p>The airship is available to the player since the beginning of the game and can be navigated physically; the game's \"world map\" consists entirely of air space, with islands that can be accessed only by airship. Most locations, however, can only be explored after having advanced the story and received an ability that would grant the player access to unexplored areas. The airship's combat abilities can be improved by customizing it to a degree, and by recruiting crew members in various parts of the world.</p>",

                "description": "<p><em>Everyday Shooter</em> is an abstract shooter by <a href=\"/search/?q=Jonathan+Mak\">Jonathan Mak</a> released through the PlayStation network. Although seemingly a top-down arcade shooter, the title is described as an album of games, where music, gameplay and visuals are interwoven, inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/5613/rez/\">Rez</a> concept. The player controls a pixel-shaped character through a series of 8 fixed-screen stages, using one stick to move and another one to shoot. The overall goal is to clear the stage of all enemies, but the mechanics to achieve this vary in each level. The same applies for combos and chain reactions. Sometimes enemies cannot be defeated directly, but require a sequence of colors or a special object that triggers the entire field. There is only a single gun with no upgrades or changes.</p>\n<p>Each stage has a different soundtrack toned to match the visuals. All sounds of destruction have been replaced by guitar notes or riffs, leading to a sea of sound that harmonizes with the overall soundtrack, causing the music to be generated procedurally.</p>\n<p>Next to the main goal there are bonus points to collect, used to unlock extras such as extra lives and new graphical effects. Completing a level opens it up in the Single Play mode, where it can be selected right away.</p>",

It tells the story of a cat burglar named Trilby who sets out to steal the family valuables from the manor of the recently deceased Sir Roderick DeFoe. But once Trilby gets inside, all the doors and windows are locked, and he cannot get out.</p>\n<p>Soon he realizes that four other people are trapped in the house as well and the house has a reason for keeping them there - a truly sinister one. Together with scavenger Philip Harty, TV reporter Simone Taylor, the youngster Jim, and the secretive AJ, Trilby has to delve into the family history to solve the secret the manor is hiding.</p>\n<p>The game is controlled through five mouse-controlled actions: walk, look, use, and talk. These can be selected from the bottom of the interface, from the inventory screen, or by cycling through them with the space bar. The entire game takes place over the course of five days, introducing a <em>whodunnit</em> theme when some characters go missing. Most puzzles are inventory-based, but some also rely on conversations. It is also possible to die during certain sequences if the player does not react quickly.</p>",

                "description": "<p><em>Deadlock: Planetary Conquest</em> is a 2D turn-based 4X strategy. Players take the roles of aliens deadlocked on a planet surface. The game has seven different races with special abilities, for example the Maugs are great scientists, ChCh-T have the highest birth rate etc. They spend turns building, expanding, and ultimately warring. The planet's surface is divided into smaller areas. Each area is home to one of the cities that need to be constructed. To colonize a new area, the player must build a colonizer. Players can expand their cities by erecting residential buildings, farms, factories, mines and research centres. Inventions made in the latter provide new units, new materials and better buildings (for example a hydroponic farm is far better than a normal farm). The residents' satisfaction is important - dissatisfied citizens (taxes are too high) protest and don't work.</p>\n<p>The battle begins after the player places their units in a foreign land. Battles are separately animated - after being initiated players have no control over them. The game also has a spying mechanic that spies can use to steal technologies. The player wins by fulfilling one of the victory conditions, for example remaining the last living race on the planet, or reaching a set number of city centres first.</p>",

As Jr., you need to eat all of the dots in a maze without running into the four ghosts that are trying to get you. The maze is now much larger, and no longer fits on a single screen. The maze will scroll around to follow the action. From time to time a tasty bonus will bounce around the screen which can be eaten for extra points. There are tricycles, kites, drums, balloons, trains, root beers, and other bonuses that appear as the levels progress. When the bonus items bounce around the screen, any dots they touch will become larger and are now worth 50 points each instead of 10. However, one of these larger dots will cause Jr. Pac-Man to slow down greatly when he eats them making it more difficult to remain one step ahead of the ghosts which constantly pursue him! Located throughout the maze are power pellets; when Jr. eats one of these, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and can now be eaten to earn even more points.</p>",

Now you are seeking revenge on Omega 19, the terrorist group which you suspect is responsible for your family's death. There are eight missions to complete which have a combination of action and puzzle solving elements. You will often need to use stealth to be successful, making sure you quietly infiltrate an area without being seen, or if you are seen making sure no one sounds an alarm.</p>\n<p>You can hide in the shadows, in crates and vents, hang from the ceiling, and sneak up on guards to kill them before they see you. Of course, when action is required, there are a wide variety of weapons that will be used throughout the game; some weapons you'll come across are a pistol, a rifle, a crossbow, grenades, proximity mines, and more. There are three different difficulty levels available.</p>",

It requires the use of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/search/?q=Zapper+light+gun\">Zapper light gun</a>. In game modes A and B, players view a swampland from a first-person perspective. The dog scares the ducks out of the swamp, one at a time in mode A or two at a time in mode B. The ducks go flying around in the air and the player has three shots and a limited amount of time to shoot the ducks before they fly away. Each round only allows a limited number of misses in order to move on successfully. As the rounds progress, the ducks begin flying faster and faster, and fewer misses are allowed. In game mode A, a second player can control the movement of the duck using a controller plugged into port 2.</p>\n<p>Mode C features target practice on clay pigeons rather than ducks. The perspective and rules here are the same, with only three shots to destroy two clay pigeons before they disappear off the horizon. Destroy enough clay pigeons to move on to the next, tougher round.</p>",

It retains the mix of a construction/ management game with real-time strategic combat in which the player either lays siege to his opponents or defends his castle against them.</p>\n<p>The campaign is again divided in two parts: the more peaceful part in which management is the primary concern of the player, and the military campaign in which the player fights to restore order to the troubled kingdom of England. However, there is some limited fighting in the peaceful campaign (mostly beasts and bandits) and the player must definitely know how to build a good economy to support his army in the military campaign. </p>\n<p>The game also offers additional modes of play, such as Kingmaker, Free Form play, multiplayer skirmish and others. There are also many ready-made historical castles which the player can either besiege or defend.</p>",

The official explanation for his disappearance was fatal overdose, but this is not enough for Ernesto's twin sons, Ram and Tommy. They embark on a quest for truth, though the Mexican wilderness and underworld urban environments inhabited by gangs, drug lords, and dangerous women.</p>\n<p>Players can explore the large areas on foot, or commandeer any vehicle they choose. Total Overdose features a fighting game-styled combo system, and smart, skilled shooting unlocks new equipment and abilities. A \"Rewind\" system allows players to repeat a sequence to nail a perfect combo, or even to turn back the clock and avoid a fatal mistake.</p>",

As in that game, players control DK by climbing with his left and right hands. The L-button makes DK grab with his left hand, and the R-button makes him grab with his right. Holding onto an object with one hand will make DK swing around it either clockwise or anti-clockwise, while pressing down L and R simultaneously will make him stop in place. DK can also attack enemies by pressing the A-button spin at them, and can even fly around if he has collected enough gems scattered around the levels.</p>\n<p>New to the game is the ability to have Diddy tag along with DK, as he does in <a href=\"/search/?q=045496830359\">Donkey Kong Country</a>. By pressing A twice when you have Diddy with you, you can launch him high into the air to collect objects you can't get and even access areas that DK simply can't reach. Diddy can also use special power-ups such as a giant hammer which smashes anything it touches.</p>",

The player races on tracks situated in Los Angeles, Miami and Philadelphia, both during daylight and at night. It's also possible to date 18 cute models, each with their own video clips. </p>\n<p>The game features two modes:</p>\n<p>In Street Mode, there are tree types of awards: money, respect and girls. Money is necessary to buy cars, tuning parts and place bets, and can be earned by winning races and collecting prizes and bets. The player receives respect points for doing tricks such as two-wheel driving or drifting. These points allow them to progress in the game (i.e. unlock races). The last type of award, girls, will date the player if they win a respect challenge. This can be a car chasing, a checkpoint run or a respect points race. There are 8 races with various crews and difficulty, each consisting of three tracks where the player will race against one or three opponents. It's also possible to drive Street Challenges (point-to-point races) against another car, where the winner takes the bet. Or the player can just cruise around the town in Cruise Zone.</p>\n<p>Arcade mode offers four types of races: Quick Race, Checkpoint Run, Ironman (set of 3-12 races which have to be won), Speed Trial (a race against time).</p>\n<p><em>SRS: Street Racing Syndicate</em> also features six multiplayer modes: Quick Race, Collection Race, Team Collection Race, Team Time Race, Team Position Race and Pink Slip Race. They can be played over LAN or on Internet using GameSpy Arcade.</p>",

                "description": "<p>Mario and friends are invited to the Star Carnival. Of course, they are thrilled to join. Whoever wins the main event, the Star Battle, receives a year's supply of candy. To win they must play through board games against each other. Mario and pals can also choose to play a more traditional party (much like other <a href=\"/game-group/mario-party-series\">Mario Party games</a>).</p>\n<p>In the first Mario Party game for Wii, the basic rules are the same: players still compete to win stars. However, the mini-games have been completely revamped to take advantage of the Wii remote. For example, some have players point the remote at the screen to shoot guns or other such things. Other mini-games use the motion sensor to shake soda cans, cut logs in half, hammer nails in place, paint, fly planes, drive cars, etc. There are still others that are played more traditionally by holding the Wii remote on its side and using the control pad to move and the buttons to perform actions, such as jumping and/or punching.</p>\n<p>Players can choose between five different modes: Party Tent, Star Battle, Mini-games, Extras Zone, or Fun Bazaar. In Party Tent mode, players play on boards with a choice between battle royales, teams, or duels. In a Battle Royale, people compete for stars: the winner is determined by number of stars and/or coins after a certain amount of turns. In Team Battle, players split off into teams. And in a duel, two players compete against each other.</p>\n<p>Star Battle is basically a duel on each board against different characters (for one player). The player wins each board by completing a certain task. For instance, the player must collect so many stars on some boards. For other boards, he or she has to get to the star with a certain amount of coins.</p>",

The protagonist, known as the Stranger, has to travel the lands in search of a time machine, go back in time to the days before Mondain created the gem, and then destroy him. The land of Sosaria is depending upon this lone warrior.</p>\n<p>Considered one of the most influential progenitors of the role-playing genre, <em>Ultima</em> is a follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1256/akalabeth-world-of-doom/\">Akalabeth</a>. It utilizes a similar basic gameplay system, including graphical 2D world map and town exploration, and 3D vector-line maze-like dungeons. The player controls a single character who must complete a number of quests, vanquishing monsters and leveling up in process. Equipment and food are available for sale in towns. World map graphics are tile-based and have significantly more detail than in <em>Akalabeth</em>. The game mixes medieval fantasy and sci-fi elements, and includes a few space combat simulation segments.</p>",

Some weapons are effective on only ground or air targets, while some are on both. There are some really advanced weapons like the auto-track mini-gun which can effectively destroy almost any kind of targets without aiming the ship.</p>\n<p>Dying in shoot'em ups can be annoying, especially if you have to start all over the beginning. However, in Raptor you can save your game between each level. If you have enough credit you can even buy multiple shields for further protection.</p>\n<p>The 2010 edition of <em>Raptor: Call of the Shadows</em> includes improved graphics and native support for higher resolutions (640x400, 960x600 and 1280x800). Standard graphics are also available.</p>",

Sir Daniel was hailed as a hero after the battle, supposedly having been mortally wounded during it, taking Zarok with him. However, it looks like the sorcerer was not defeated in that battle. A hundred years later, he appears again, robbing people of their souls to build an army of undead. Unleashing waves of necromantic energy, Zarok inadvertently revives Sir Daniel as well. Now a skeletal corpse, the knight must correct the mistakes of the past and defeat Zarok once and for all.</p>\n<p><em>MediEvil</em> is an action game in which the player controls Sir Daniel, exploring 3D environments and fighting many enemies that stand on his path towards the ultimate goal. The protagonist starts with his own detachable arm as the basic weapon; however, later he acquires swords and other melee weapons, as well as bows. Money can be collected and spent on items and equipment sold by gargoyle merchants. The hero must also find various rune stones that will allow him to access new areas.</p>\n<p>Each level contains a chalice that can be filled with souls of defeated enemies. Sir Daniel may take a chalice only after having vanquished a sufficient amount of foes. Getting the chalice enables access to the Hall of Heroes, where the protagonist can receive new weapons. Collecting all the chalices in the game unlocks a special ending.</p>",

                "description": "<p>A Venezuelan billionaire named Ramon Solano hires a mercenary to rescue general Carlos Carmona, who attempted a coup d’état and failed. After a successful completion of the objective Solano refuses to pay and tries to kill the mercenary, who barely escapes.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, Carmona and Solano take over Venezuela, pulling off a successful coup, capturing the country's oil platforms, putting the world on alert as they seize total control of the country. Unbeknownst to them, the mercenary has survived and is now plotting revenge against the two. The mercenary must take contracts from rival factions such as Universal Petroleum, an oil company whose business is threatened by Solano, the P.L.A.V. (People’s Liberation Army of Venezuela), who are a force of rebel soldiers determined to take back their country, the Jamaican Pirates, who profit from Solano's forces, the A.N. (Allied Nations), who have entered the company to try and bring back stability to the region, and the Chinese Army, who hope to take control of Venezuela as well, marking themselves as a true superpower.</p>\n<p><em>Mercenaries 2: World in Flames</em> is a free-roaming driving and action game. In the beginning the player selects one of three mercenaries from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/16313/mercenaries-playground-of-destruction/\">previous game</a> (Mattias Nilsson, Chris Jacobs and Jennifer Mui). Each merc has a special ability: Jennifer can run faster than others, Mattias regenerates his health faster, and Chris can carry more ammo. The gameplay is similar to that of the preceding game, with a few minor changes, one of which is a new way to hijack tanks: whereas in the previous game the player could simply walk up to the tank and automatically hijack it, it is now necessary to participate in quick-time events to get rid of the enemy gunner. It is possible to use a grappling hook to latch onto passing helicopters in order to hijack them. As opposed to the previous game, player characters can swim.</p>\n<p>The protagonist now has a \"headquarters\" of sorts, where he or she can stockpile weapons, supply crates and vehicles. To obtain these stockpiles the protagonist must recruit three certain soldiers unlockable in the game: a helicopter pilot named Ewan Garrett, who delivers stockpile crates found by the player character to the headquarters; a mechanic named Eva Navarro, who will repair and stock vehicles, and is used for artillery strikes; and a fighter pilot named Misha Milanich, who is used for air strikes. Fiona Taylor reprises her role, giving the player technical information and training missions.</p>\n<p>There is no more black market contacts to purchase supplies or airstrikes; instead players must take complete jobs for contacts scattered on the island. Completing jobs for these contacts will supply the headquarters with materials such as weapons, medikits, and artillery support. It is also possible to stockpile vehicles by driving back to their headquarters, keeping them at the garage for use in missions. Also, gas is needed to bring in supplies or call in airstrikes, which can be obtained by either completing contracts or collecting them scattered throughout the country.</p>\n<p>Once again, bounties come into play, but instead of the \"Deck of 52\" from the first game, there are now \"High Value Targets\", military leaders that have defected from the Venezuela military and declared themselves independent from Solano as well as competing factions. They are scattered throughout the map; capturing them alive will grant the player character more money, while killing them will only net half the bounty as a reward. There are also \"treasures\" lying around the island, such as fuel cans, weapons schematics and even pirate treasure chests; each has their own monetary value for collecting them.</p>\n<p>There are also new vehicles in the game, as well classic vehicles, such as modernized tanks, more powerful helicopters and even (for the first time) boats and other watercraft such as jet ski, as well as civilian muscle cars, high-end racing cars, and specialized vehicles for each faction.</p>",

                "description": "<p>Isla Trueno, Colombia is a nice little island. Beautiful beaches, clear water, and awesome looking jungles as far as one can see. It's also home to an ultra-rare form of uranium called Black 235, whose trade allows the local dictator General Manuel Vasquez to acquire military hardware and infrastructure. At first glance Vasquez is basically a drug dealer who was send by the cartel to Isla Trueno to run their drug operations on the island. This of course didn't keep him from overthrowing the government, cleansing the island from any of his opposition and clean out whole neighborhoods with his deaths squads. The world watched it happening. The island is after all rich with resources and everyone wants a piece of it. So all is well on Isla Trueno? Well, it would be if the government Vasquez overthrew hadn't been a US-backed one. Now a highly trained special ops team arrives on the island with one goal and one goal only: kill Vasquez.</p>\n<p>In most of the 16 missions of the game, the player is put into the shoes of Gunnery Sergeant Tyler Wells, a MOS 0317 (Scout Sniper). Crawling from cover to cover in first person with one of the four different sniper models including the Russian Dragunov and the German MSG-90, carefully lining up shots and vanishing into the scenery after the kill has been made. Tyler also has access to a silenced pistol and throwing knives if things get a bit more personal, but most of the time the player views his targets from at least a 100 meters away.</p>\n<p>Getting the kill-shot at such a range isn't an easy task, especially considering that the AI can hear and find the origin of a shot pretty fast. So one shot, one kill or the whole camp is alerted to the player's presence. In this regard, <em>Sniper: Ghost Warrior</em> is all about realism. When using the sniper, many things factor into whether or not the bullet will hit its target. The trajectory for example is influenced by the distance (the higher, the more the bullet looses velocity until the target), the wind direction (moving the bullet from left to right) and the pulse of Tyler. Expecting to run to cover and then immediately make the headshot is a no-go and instead an exercise in trying to keep the cross-hair from swinging around so much. If the enemy is moving, the player also has to factor in the time the bullet takes to the target. In addition there are some materials the bullet can go through - including multiple enemies standing in a row. At the lower difficulty levels, the player can hold his breath to activate a slow-motion effect, the enemies are marked red (and friendlies can't even be injured) and a small red circle shows where the bullet will hit to make it easier for inexperienced players. If the target zone is around the head area, a (deactivate-able) killcam will activate, showing how the bullet flies to and into the target, making for a gory depiction of the kill.</p>\n<p>The game however doesn't solely feature sniper stealth missions. Instead during the campaign, the player will slip into the boots of other members of the team like the spotter, which makes out targets for the sniper and normal grunts. They run guns blazing through the enemy camp, using standard equipment like the M16 or AK-47 (picked up from fallen enemies) as well as a destructive perk to take out the enemy while searching for the secret laptops scattered around the levels. They unlock access to email-messages, giving a little more context to what is happening on the island.</p>\n<p>In single player, the game uses a mixture of medipacks and automatic healing. If the player's health goes under 30 and he gets to safety fast, his health will regenerate back to 30. For everything above he needs to find said medi-packs of which he can carry five at a time. In multiplayer it's all about auto regeneration. Here up to eight players can try to find and kill each other on the six large maps in three different game-modes: Deathmatch, Team-Deathmatch, and VIP. The latter is a 'King of the Hill' variant in which a random player is assigned the status of VIP at the start of the round. Killing him, will result in more points for the killer and transfer of the VIP status to that player. In multiplayer each player carries the standard equipment sniper, pistol and knives. Which sniper he gets depends on his class choice. Each of the four classes also differs in how much health they have and how fast they can run.</p>",

In this game you play as an entirely new character named Delsin Rowe, a conduit who becomes aware of his powers after a confrontation with an escaped inmate. When his abilities come under the attention of the Department of Unified Protection (D.U.P.) and their leader Brooke Augustine, Delsin is faced to battle them head on in the streets of Seattle. As a member of the Akomish Native-American tribe, Delsin knows there is nothing more important than your family. And thus he will do whatever necessary to protect them, even if it means becoming evil to do so.</p>\n<p>Like the previous entries in the <em>inFAMOUS</em> series, <em>Second Son</em> is a 3rd-person action game that allows the player to choose between being a good or evil character. You again play as a conduit, but this time you have access to a much greater variety of powers. Across your playthrough, Delsin will have the chance to obtain four different powers, the first two being Smoke and Neon. Each power allows for a different playstyle and changes the dynamics of the game. The Smoke power for instance is more aggressive and used for up-close combat while the Neon power is better situated for long-range, quick movement encounters. The player can unleash a powerful move called Karmic Overload once their karma power is maxed out. Each of your powers can be upgraded by collecting blast shards all around the map. Depending on whether you have good or evil karma, the player will be locked out of certain upgrades until there karma becomes the opposite. Playing through the story gives access to a number of karma decisions where you have to make a good or evil decision usually involving another character, with your choice giving you an increase in that karma. </p>\n<p>The game is open-world and allows movement across the whole city of Seattle. There are side missions to complete and collectibles to find. These side missions include spraying anti-D.U.P. images all over the city, finding and killing a secret D.U.P. agent, and searching for hidden audio files scattered around the area. The city is broken up into many D.U.P. controlled districts which can become less occupied by the enemy the more the player completes side quests. After taking the districts down to 30% controlled by the D.U.P., you gain access to a District Showdown where you face off against a tough enemy opposition and winning that battle removes the D.U.P. from the area and gives access to a fast-travel spot.</p>",

The problem is that there are not enough princesses to rescue or dragons to slay for all the heroes, so Rodrigo is currently unemployed. Another problem involves pirates who want to raid the city Smashville and create flying ships with magical gloomstones. Confronted with this situation, Rodrigo is very disillusioned. Just in time, the dwarf Ramil hires Rodrigo to find his wife Jasmin, who was captured by the pirates and is held in the city of Endavin.</p>\n<p><em>Rent-a-Hero</em> is a traditional point-and-click adventure. The characters are modeled in 3D but the background graphics are pre-rendered. There are over 30 locations and over 30 characters to interact with.

However, beside completing this main objective, JJ also has to find a way to rescue his friends, Apple and Champ.</p>\n<p>Based on the anime of the same name, <em>Zillion</em> is a platformer with an emphasis on exploration and problem-solving rather than on fast-paced \"jump and run\" gameplay. The game is set almost entirely in the underground base. Capsules containing key codes and power-ups are scattered around the vast environments. Common obstacles include enemy guards, tripwires, laser turrets, and force fields. Rooms must be unlocked by using computer ID cards and inputting the correct four-digit code. Specific actions such as turning off barriers, deactivating traps, etc., are sometimes required as well. </p>\n<p>JJ uses a gun similar to the Sega Master System Light Phaser to defend himself and blast open the capsules. Upgrades for health, speed, jumping ability, and gun power can be found; Opa Opa, a character from <a href=\"/search/?q=fantasy+zone\">Fantasy Zone</a> games, provides character enhancements. </p>\n<p>Once Apple or Champ are rescued, they can be controlled by the player, with the ability to switch between the three heroes. Each of these characters has his/her own strengths and weaknesses; Apple is physically weaker, but is able to jump higher, while Champ is stronger, but slower.</p>",

After you have successfully won some of them, a new game mode becomes available, domination. In domination there are about three or four different areas scattered around the map to be controlled by your team. For a certain amount of seconds you control one area, a point is added to your score. The more areas you control, the faster your team's score rises. When you or the other team reaches a certain score, the game is over. The third mode is called capture the flag, every team has a flag to defend and tries to capture the other team's flag to score a point. </p>\n<p>The fourth game mode is called assault. This mode requires completion of real missions, such as attacking an enemy base and destroying a specific object in it. Again, there are two teams, the defenders and the attackers. You have to complete the mission in a certain time, for example five or ten minutes. If you were successful, your team has to defend this time and the other team attacks. But the attacking team now only has as much time as you needed to attack.</p>\n<p>All these modes are either playable in single or multiplayer mode. If playing alone, you have a large menu with orders you can give your bots. Also, all weapons were redesigned, and some new ones are added.</p>",

The player takes on the role of an American agent working for the OSS (the organization that later became the CIA) stationed in Berlin at the end of World War II, tasked with preventing the Russian troops from getting hold of the research Germany had been conducting into nuclear weaponry. As an elite sniper, the style of play is much less run-and-gun and much more about finding good positions, lining up shots and taking out the enemy before he even knows where you are.</p>\n<p>The single-player campaign takes place over 28 missions set in and around Berlin. Players use stealth tactics, and things like wind and background noise can be a factor when lining up shots. When a shot is performed particularly well, players are rewarded with a 'bullet cam' which follows the bullet in slow-motion from gun barrel to target.</p>\n<p>The game also includes a multi-player mode with a number of different game types.</p>",

                "description": "<p>The private corporation O.C.P. have taken control of the overwhelmed police force of Detroit. In order to deal with an immense crime wave hitting the city, a cyborg law enforcement agent has been created.</p>\n<p><em>RoboCop</em> is a side-scrolling action game that consists of six stages. These six assignments include locations at the streets of Old Detroit, city hall, a warehouse, O.C.P. headquarters, the steelworks, and the board room. RoboCop dispatches his enemies with punches and a handgun (a special issue Auto-9) that has an infinite amount of ammo. RoboCop is not invincible though, as he can only take so many hits before his power runs out, plus his battery power gradually drains as he moves. However, lost power can be restored by finding power icons, and lost battery power can be restored by finding battery chargers found throughout the stages. Other items RoboCop can find and use are a machine gun that comes with fifty bullets and the powerful cobra gun.</p>\n<p>RoboCop has four functions he can use. The infrared vision function lets RoboCop detect weak walls that can be punched in order to reveal shortcuts. The punch function lets the player know that the enemy they're facing can only be defeated by punching, no use of weapons is permitted. The foe detector function shows how close RoboCop is to the boss enemy of a stage. The faster it blinks, the closer he is. The energy/power alarm function will start sounding an alarm if either RoboCop's energy or power gets too low.</p>\n<p>There is also a target practice bonus round between stages, where the player has to shoot as many targets as they can in a limited amount of time to earn bonus points to add to their score.</p>",

One year later, after their reunion, Adam's brother Sammy returned from school to find their apartment in a mess, and Adam nowhere to be seen, and after calling his two friends, one of them notices a photo of Adam chained to a wall, next to someone they knew very well - Mr. X, who returned to turn the peaceful city once again into a war zone. Now, Axel, Blaze, Sammy, and Axel's good friend Max, a pro wrestler, must head out to stop Mr. X once again...hopefully for good...</p>\n<p><em>Streets of Rage 2</em> differs from the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/6599/streets-of-rage/\">previous title</a> in several ways. There are changes in both graphics (characters now are bigger, more detailed and with more animation frames, and scenarios are less grainy) and gameplay (the rocket move was replaced by a special move that doubles in offense and defense along several new moves), along other new features such as life bars (and names) for all enemies and the radically different new characters.</p>",

                "description": "<p>Skira is a lovely little island in the Pacific Ocean just north of Japan and was always the center of many conflicts because of its strategic value. Sadly, nice beaches and crystal blue water isn't the only thing Skira has to offer. After the second world war, the Russians managed to gain control over the island and found a huge oil deposit of a size similar to the ones in the middle east. No one cared at first but China's economy grew and grew and with it their need for oil. Then the recession hit. China's manufacturing industry was especially affected and civil unrest got stronger and stronger bringing the country closer and closer to a civil war. Because of these riots the National People's Army guarding the Russian border under the lead of General Zhang was put on high alert, further increasing the tension between China and the international community. As Russia was preparing for the worst-case-scenario, General Zhang suddenly invaded Skira saying that the island is the rightful historical property of China. Since Russia is too busy preparing for a possible war against China on the ground, they ask the USA for assistance in regaining control over the island. Soon afterwards UH-10 Black Hawks are sighted over Skira and in one of those helicopters: the player.</p>\n<p><em>Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising</em> is an action-orientated military-simulation. The player moves through the mission areas in a typical first-person-shooter fashion and has to fulfill certain objectives like blowing up a generator or taking out anti-air-guns in order for the invasion to move along. But since realism plays an important part in this game, the player can't just walk up to the enemy base and shoot everyone. Instead he and his three squad-mates have to use the different stances like crouching and couching to move from cover to cover in different formations and think before a bullet is fired or in short: the player needs to take a tactical approach in order to not end up dead in the high grass. To that end, he has a radial, context-sensitive menu at his disposal with which he can give specific orders to his teammates. In addition, the player can change the weapons-load-out of each team-mate (and himself) at the beginning of each mission to what best fits the situation. The armory only covers real-world weaponry like the MK16 MOD 0 Assault Rifle. If all the sneaking didn't help and combat ensues, the player has to watch both his blood- and injury-status. Depending on where and how badly he has been wounded e.g. his arm, his ability to keep his weapon straight decreases. In addition each wound causes the player to loose blood and of course once he has lost too much blood, he'll lose consciousness and the mission is over.</p>\n<p>The game features several multiplayer-modes. The players can either take on the whole campaign together or just one mission or engage each other in \"Destruction\", which is similar to Team Deathmatch, or \"Infiltration\" in which the smaller team has to fulfill an objective while the other has to prevent it from destroying their target. As opposed to the single-player campaign where the player has only limited access to vehicles like jeeps or helicopters, the selection in multiplayer is much greater and covers everything from a HUMVEE to a AH-1 Cobra helicopter. The PC-version also includes a powerful map-editor.</p>",

Now caught in the middle of civil warfare, their only choice is to fight it out and stay alive as long as possible. </p>\n<p><em>Raven Squad</em> is your standard tactical real time strategy game with a twist. You can control your squad members in first person view as well. The RTS section contains no base building as you'll be given a set number of units for each level to complete. It plays very much like <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1714/ground-control/\">Ground Control</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/12373/desert-rats-vs-afrika-korps/\">Desert Rats vs. Afrika Korps</a>. The first person mode plays pretty much like any first person shooter in the market, giving you the advantage to perform one shot kills (eg. head-shots). The game features single player co-op as well.</p>",

In this tale set in 2038 Detroit, the player takes control of three different androids and takes them on a journey to discover what becoming human is all about. Each of the protagonists has its own story and consequences that come with choices selected and actions made by the player.</p>\n<p>The game opens with Connor, an android sent by the Cyberlife corporation to deal with deviants. Deviants are androids that deviate from their programming and start to become conscious and experience human emotions. Kara is a housekeeper android designed for cleaning, cooking, looking after children and other such tasks. She becomes a deviant in order to protect Alice, the little girl she lives with, from an abusive father. And finally, Markus. Markus was lucky to have lived with a caring master who treated him as a sentient being and taught him a lot. But after things turned south and Markus was shot and tossed into an android scrapyard, he had to crawl out of mud and reassemble himself. This in turn led him to seek refuge and become the key figure in an android revolt. He could try to seek freedom peacefully or go to war with humans.</p>\n<p>With Connor tasked to eliminate all deviants, he and Markus start as enemies. But choices he makes may well turn him into something more, or he may choose to stay an obedient machine and care only about the mission. Choices the player makes will not only affect a single scene or specific character, but also the overall opinion of people around the world. The butterfly effect is shown as a tree structure showing players all possible paths and outcomes, but unlocking only those they reached during gameplay. Aside from actions which affected the branching story, being aware of your surroundings, finding out things and noticing objects and their whereabouts will unlock additional dialogue options and possibilities.</p>\n<p>As in previous Quantic Dream titles, the camera doesn't constantly follow the player and instead tries to create a cinematic feel by being able to switch between preset cameras on each and every scene. A little freedom in looking around is given, but not much and more often you won't be able to see the exact spot you wish to examine in more detail as even 1st-person perspective is tied to only a handful of areas in each chapter. Each of the game protagonists can be killed, some even early in the game, which removes all future chapters pertaining to the character in question. Points are awarded by unlocking paths in each chapter, which can then be used to unlock bonuses such as a 3D character gallery, making-of artwork, soundtrack, and interview videos. The main menu features an interactive android who will comment on the player's choices and otherwise interact with the player.</p>",

But there are other insects as well; spiders, bees, dragonflies, and earwigs. Nature is dangerous. Luckily, there's a bug zapper that can shoot arrows at these insects and destroy them.</p>\n<p>Millipede is the sequel to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/141/centipede/\">Centipede</a>, and features similar gameplay, but with a new swarm of insects! The goal is to destroy the multi-segmented millipede as it traverses its way through the mushroom forest towards the bottom of the screen. When all millipede segments have been destroyed, the player will progress to the next, more difficult level. Millipedes and other creatures are all worth a different amount of points. Occasionally dynamite will appear on the screen, which will explode if shot by the bug zapper. With a well-timed shot, numerous millipede segments (and other insects as well) can be taken out as they pass by.</p>",

Burroughs</a> and the music of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/5350/thomas-dolby/\">Thomas Dolby Robertson</a>. While experiencing an original Poe-esque adventure, the player is transported into several of Poe's most famous works including <em>The Cask of Amontillado</em> and <em>The Tell-Tale Heart</em>. All of the stories are surrealistically rendered with claymation figures and haunting music. Burrough's reading of <em>The Masque of the Red Death</em> is not to be missed.</p>\n<p>Outside of Poe's literature, the game tells the tale of a nameless protagonist who is visiting his uncle Edwin (Played by William S. Burroughs) and his brother Henry and the young Elise. As time goes on, Henry &amp; Elise engage in a sordid relationship that Edwin does not approve of and the story takes many dark turns that ultimately leads to the characters insanity.</p>",

In this age of steel, the Motorhead Empire has conquered and enslaved almost the entire planet. The last free nation, the Republic of Silverhead, tries to bring the Motorhead Empire down using its newly developed weapon, the lightning bomb.</p>\n<p>Apart from its unusual Steampunk setting, Steel Empire is a fairly traditional side-scrolling shooter. At the beginning of every level, the player gets to choose between a striker plane and a zeppelin. While the plane is faster, the zeppelin has a longer life bar and can therefore sustain more damage. Both ships use the same standard weapon, which can be fired forwards or backwards, as well as bombs that are released automatically while firing. Also available is a limited number of lightning bombs that damage or destroy all enemies on screen. </p>\n<p>Defeated enemies often drop power-ups, including hearts that replenish health, lightning bombs, bonus points, 1-UPs, options and experience points.</p>\n<p>Options are small \"drones\" that fly alongside the player's ship and mimic its behaviour.</p>\n<p>Experience points can be collected to level up the ships' weapons (up to level 20) and thereby increase their fire power.</p>",

She infiltrates Umbrella Corporation's headquarters in Paris, where she is captured and knocked out. When she comes to, she finds herself in a prison on a remote island. Freed by a friendly guard, Claire faces several problems. Not only is the island under attack by an unknown assailant, but there has been another outbreak of the T-Virus and the island is crawling with zombies and other mutated creatures. Claire not only has to face the undead, but also the commander of the base, a mad aristocrat with family ties to the origins of Umbrella Corporation and the T-Virus. And escaping from the island is only the beginning of Claire's ordeals.</p>\n<p><em>Code: Veronica</em> continues the survival horror gameplay of its predecessors: the protagonist explores the surroundings, fighting monsters and solving puzzles. However, Code: Veronica is the first game in the series to do away with pre-rendered backgrounds, using a fully polygonal 3D engine instead, which allows for features such as real-time lighting and camera movement. Still, such movements are only used sparingly, and the use of perspective is mostly unchanged from earlier installments: the camera automatically switches to different static angles, showing the protagonist, monsters, and rooms from different spooky viewpoints.</p>\n<p>Most of the weapons from the earlier games make return appearances: knife, handguns, shotgun, grenade launcher, and crossbow are all featured. There are also new weapons including a sniper rifle, an AK-47, and several guns only found in pairs, which can be used to target two enemies at the same time. Several weapons upgrades can also be found.</p>\n<p>Similar to the earlier games, the player will not only control Claire, but also two other characters: Claire's fellow prisoner Steve, and her brother Chris.</p>",

Of course the Queen does not want his tea so she sends in a British Secret Agent who has to stop Dr. T. <em>Jack Keane</em>, a rather unsuccessful captain, is chosen to escort the agent to Tooth Island where Dr. T has his base of operations. When he meets the agent in Cape Town it quickly becomes clear that the agent does not really know anything about spying even though he thinks he is the best of the best. So Jack unwillingly takes over the operation and tries to help the agent stop Dr. T.</p>\n<p>Players take the role of Jack in 3rd person perspective. Later in the game the player can also control Amanda, an American henchman who is hired by Dr. T to get rid of Jack. Amanda eventually learns she is on the wrong side and begins helping Jack instead.</p>\n<p>This adventure game uses a 3D engine with a fixed camera and everything is controlled by the mouse. The left mouse button is used mostly for looking at objects and moving around the gameplay screen, while the the right button performs all important actions.</p>\n<p>Upon hovering over items, the appropriate action appears: walking, running, looking, picking up, talking or using. Items are gathered in the inventory at the top of the screen. They can be examined, used in the environment or combined to create a new item. There are also bonus items available when certain non-essential actions are completed. These have nothing to do with the main story but provide bonus riddles. There is another bonus if certain riddles are completed early before they stop the game's progress.</p>\n<p>Other options offered in the game include using the \"x\" keyboard key to highlight all interactive spots in the current view, turning subtitles on or off, inventory show or hide, and various screen resolution settings. The playable character will run if the left-mouse button is double-clicked.</p>\n<p>The story-based problems all involve choosing the proper inventory item (or combination of items) in the environment or on another character. There are no puzzles as such otherwise. Climbing up and down and occasional jumping are done with a click of the mouse, but there is no time-limit or risk, since your character cannot die in the game.</p>\n<p>The graphics and humour are reminiscent of the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/company/72/lucasfilm-games/\">LucasArts</a> adventures especially the <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/group/1/monkey-island-series/\">Monkey Island series</a>.</p>",

Under the command of Team Leader Bishop a second squad cleared the backyards of the city while the other team enjoyed themselves in the casinos. The player takes control over Bishop and visits the other, dirty side of Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>The gameplay hasn't changed since the first title so the game again puts four team mates at the player's side which he can give orders with the tactical interface including \"Move to\" or\"Use Gadget\". As he moves through the enemy infested areas, getting covered by his team, defusing bombs, rescuing hostages, two of the new features become evident: the Persistent Elite Creation (P.E.C.) and the Advanced Combat Enhancement Specialisation (ACES).</p>\n<p>The P.E.C. allows the player to build a unique identity and save his progress from one match to another. Both in single and in multiplayer the player gains experience for killing bad guys and successfully completing objectives. Has he gained enough experience for the next rank, he will unlock new weapons, body armour and other more or less useful items. The ACES-system takes it a step further and rewards you a big chunk of experience and powerful weapons if the player completes challenges inside one of three categories: Marksman, Close Quarters and Assault. These challenges range from simply completing a specific Story Mode map to making a bunch of head shots in a row.</p>",

Two young mecha pilots, Riki and his sister Mami board a giant mecha called Bangai-O, in order to confront the pirates in battle and foil their villainous plans.</p>\n<p><em>Bangai-O</em> is a multi-directional shooter and a spiritual successor to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/52346/hover-attack/\">Hover Attack</a>. The player maneuvers the titular mecha and shoots in eight directions. Two firing modes represent switching between the two pilots. Riki fires homing missiles, while Mami's shots bounce off walls. Enemies drop fruits upon defeat, which are equivalent to power-ups in other games. It is also possible to execute a special attack that consists of a burst of shots fired in all directions. Scoring successful combos (or increasing explosion count in the Dreamcast version) leads to higher-level power-ups.</p>",

Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.</p>\n<p>This was one of the earliest games to include a level editor, allowing the creation of new level designs with no programming skill.</p>",

                "description": "<p>In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku (\"Warring States\") period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. </p>\n<p><em>Nobunaga's Ambition</em> is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to <a href=\"/search/?q=Koei\">Koei</a>'s better known <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/9093/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms/\">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a> game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.</p>\n<p>During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe &amp; assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.</p>",

This effect nearly ended the life of Oblivion, a 'thing' that drifts through space, consuming anything that ends up in its way. Also during this explosion, a new world was created. In this world lies the Turok family tree, and Oblivion knows that the only way the pain the lies within can be stopped is to destroy the Turok line. </p>\n<p>The third title in the <em>Turok</em> series allows you to choose who will become the successor of the Turok lineage, either Danielle Fireseed or her brother Joseph. Each has unique paths through the same levels, as Joseph's small size allows him to fit into air ducts to take the low road, while Danielle's magnetic grappling hook allows her to take the high road. Each also has unique upgrades to basic weapons. While Danielle's shotgun upgrade coats the shrapnel in napalm to immolate anything they touch, Joseph's instead charges them with electricity, causing them to ricochet off of walls and floors. The story is told through in-game cutscenes with highly detailed models. There are no keys to collect this time around, as each level leads linearly into the next.</p>\n<p><em>Turok 2</em>'s multiplayer mode returns, and includes the ability to add computer controlled bots. Each playable character in multiplayer mode has a unique set of weapons they can use.</p>",

                "description": "<p>Just like its predecessors, <em>Silent Hill: Downpour</em> is a survival horror game set in the town and the surroundings of Silent Hill. This entry features a convicted felon called Murphy Pendleton as the protagonist. He has been incarcerated for many years after stealing a police cruiser. After a riot at the Ryall State Corrections Facility where he is locked up, he is transferred with some other inmates to the Wayside Maximum Security Prison. During the transport that brings them near Silent Hill, the road suddenly ends into a void and the driver crashes the bus through barriers, down the hill. When Murphy regains consciousness, he manages to escape from his captors and looks for a way out through the surroundings. Through the story Murphy meets people from the area, fellow escaped prisoners and members of prison security. When he encounters strange entities and occurrences however, the line between dreams and reality starts to blur.</p>\n<p>In the tradition of the series, <em>Downpour</em> combines exploring abandoned surroundings, talking to characters, and solving puzzles, set against a slow, psychological horror theme. Different from the previous game <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/44053/silent-hill-shattered-memories/\">Silent Hill: Shattered Memories</a> is the return of combat. Murphy often has to fight off monsters using a variety of weapons, but he can carry only one melee and one ranged weapon. These also deteriorate over time. Murphy can also fight creatures when unarmed, but can not block their attacks when doing so. There is no visible health system, but when Murphy is in bad shape his clothes become bloody and he starts to limp. At key moments of the game the player has to make a number of decisions that define the moral compass. This eventually leads to different endings. Next to the main storyline there are different sidequests that are optional for completion.</p>\n<p>Entirely new to the series is the introduction of a weather system. There is a full day and night cycle and rain often warns the player of danger that is approaching. It is possible to hide until the weather becomes better again. Most of the game is set in the nature and surroundings of Silent Hill, with mountains, woods, and streams, but also locations in the city as well as the series' famous transfer to the industrial hell of the Otherworld when the town's evil influence distorts the environment.</p>",

                "description": "<p><em>Sonic and Knuckles</em> continues the story directly from where <a href=\"/search/?q=010086010794\">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> left off. The explosion from the Death Egg sends Sonic flying deep into Floating Island's Mushroom Hills. Sonic knows of the Master Emerald hidden somewhere on Floating Island, and is sure that Dr. Robotnik wants it to give his Death Egg limitless power. Knuckles probably knows where it is - but can Sonic stop Robotnik's plans and find the Master Emerald all while fighting off Knuckles? Meanwhile, Knuckles is guarding Floating Island when he's attacked by one of Robotnik's robots! He quickly begins a chase for revenge.</p>\n<p><em>Sonic &amp; Knuckles</em> is the fourth game in the Sonic series. It retains the same basic features as in the previous Sonic games (speed, rings for protection, Special Stages with Chaos Emeralds) as well as the three different shield types introduced in <em>Sonic 3</em> (Fire, Water and Electric). Players can select either of the two title characters for play - either Sonic, or the all-new Knuckles the Echidna. Knuckles cannot jump as high as Sonic, but he can glide by holding the jump button while in the air. If you glide into a wall, Knuckles will also be able to climb it. He can also break through walls that Sonic can't. With these abilities, Knuckles can access different areas from Sonic, making for each level an entirely new experience.</p>\n<p>Unlike <em>Sonic 3</em>, <em>Sonic &amp; Knuckles</em> features three bonus stages - two are available by jumping into the lamppost checkpoint stars (as in <a href=\"/search/?q=4974365540883\">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>. These stages give you the chance to earn bonus rings, lives and power-ups. The first is a Casino-themed level where you can jump into a slot machine and earn (or lose!) rings. The second is a more skill-based level where you must time your jumps off orbs to launch higher and collect bonuses. If you hit the barrier at the bottom of the stage, it ends. The other type of bonus stage is the \"Special Stage\" seen in <em>Sonic 3</em>, which, as previously, can be accessed by jumping into giant rings hidden within the levels themselves. If the player collects all the blue spheres in these stages (while avoiding all the red ones) they will earn a Chaos Emerald.</p>\n<p>A unique feature of the <em>Sonic &amp; Knuckles</em> cart is the ability to \"Lock-On\" previous Sonic games into a cartridge slot at the top. Adding <em>Sonic 3</em> will combine both <em>Sonic 3</em> and <em>Sonic &amp; Knuckles</em> into one long game, as well as adding the ability to save, and use Tails in the <em>Sonic &amp; Knuckles</em> levels. Plugging in <em>Sonic 2</em> lets players use Knuckles in <em>Sonic 2</em>, as well allowing the use of his glide and wall climb abilities. Finally, plugging in the original <a href=\"/search/?q=010086010091\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> cart lets the player access unlimited level variations of the Blue Sphere bonus stage. Subsequent re-releases of <em>Sonic &amp; Knuckles</em> have also included most of these bonus features.</p>",

Primary and secondary aerial and ground-based targets must be destroyed on each of these. You are armed with a cannon, AMRAAM long-range air-to-air missile, Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missile, and the Maverick air-to-ground missile.</p>\n<p>11 camera angles including internal and external views of the plane exist. To help new players there is a training mode, with options to disable crashes and automate take-off and landing. Enemy AI is responsive, but a targeting computer helps you take them out before they can do it to you. The game incorporates two \"Director's Modes\" which cut away from your cockpit to highlight special events occurring elsewhere in the game world, like enemy base launching fighters, SAM sites launching SAMs, and your missiles hitting the target.</p>",

The player moves left and right to aim at an alien, then shoots a bullet up the screen, and the alien it hits is killed. The aliens are classed as Drones, Emissaries, Hornets and Commanders, with those higher up the screen scoring more points when destroyed. At set intervals an enemy will move down the screen towards you, escorting a bomber, which is a moment of high danger. Clear a wave and another is generated.</p>",

Enhancements to the original games include cross-platform multiplayer, matchmaking functionality, support for higher resolutions and different viewing modes such as widescreen. The mobile versions have touch controls with multitouch gestures, pinching to zoom and swipes to flip between tabs, along with the text in a larger font. It also incorporates improvements introduced in the sequel <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/2465/baldurs-gate-ii-shadows-of-amn/\">Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn</a> and its expansion packs, adding classes, class kits and subraces that were previously not available in the original game. The developer lists over 400 improvements over the original game, including cleaned up code.</p>\n<p>This edition adds a new adventure called The Black Pits. It is completely separated from the main game and is played with a new party. The player may use the provided six characters (including pre-defined behaviour scripts) or create them from scratch. The party was captured by the Drow Baeloth who opened up a fighting area, the Black Pits, in the Underdark. Baeloth tries to use them as cannon fodder and so the heroes have to survive several arena fights. Between fights, the player can use reward money to buy additional equipment from merchants.</p>\n<p>There are also three new NPC characters that can join the party: the monk Rasaad yn Bashir, the wild mage Neera and the Blackguard (a new class) Dorn II-Khan. Each character has its own, additional quest line and (in the case of of Neera and Rasaad) also a new area. Through a patch, the developers later introduced the sorcerer Baeloth, antagonist of the Black Pits adventure, as fourth new NPC. However, he does not have any new content except dialogue. The original cinematics are replaced by new, hand-drawn cinematics directed by <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/565763/nat-jones/\">Nat Jones</a>. There is also a new collection of player character voice sets. This new version supports downloadable content, it is opened up for modding and it incorporates an autoupdate function.</p>",

                "description": "<p><em>Jagged Alliance: Back in Action</em> is the official remake of <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/356/jagged-alliance-2/\">Jagged Alliance 2</a>. It features the same story and has its own style of gameplay. The game is set in Arulco, a fictive island which suffers because of the mad Deidranna Reitman, a female dictator. The player character gets hired by the former leader of the country to kill Deidranna. To achieve this aim the player can recruit a team of mercenaries and send them to Arulco to free the country. In the beginning, players can buy cheap mercenaries only to conquer different sectors in the game. By conquering these sectors, the player gains resources they can re-invest to get better mercenaries.</p>\n<p>As in its predecessors, the playing field is divided into two areas. The first being the Arulco map, where the player may view cities, hired mercenaries, nearby enemy soldiers, and other locations. Here, the player can oversee movement of their own mercenaries to coordinate attack and defense. The second is in tactical mode, where the player may directly control mercenaries (for the most part during combat or while exploring an area) and view them from a free rotating camera.</p>\n<p><em>Back in Action</em> is the first game in the series that introduces real-time gameplay. While the previous games in tactical mode were turn-based, this game uses a system called <em>Plan &amp; Go</em> where the player can pause the game and give the mercenaries orders which they should follow. These orders can also be combined and bound to other actions. The main focus of the game is set on the tactical combats.</p>\n<p>Besides the main quest, which is killing the dictator Deidranna, there are also a lot of side-quests which can be solved to gain more money, items, or even new mercenaries. Some of these quests were available in the original game, but several new quests have also been introduced in this game. During the game the mercenaries gain experience for killing enemies or performing other tasks. When the mercenary levels up, points may be distributed to increase their stats and skills. However, there is also a level 10 cap which prevents the player from having super-soldiers.</p>\n<p><strong>Downloadable Content (DLC)</strong>\n1. <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/60425/jagged-alliance-back-in-action-urban-specialist-kit/\">Jagged Alliance: Back in Action - Urban Specialist Kit - Minor DLC</a> (April, 2013).\n- <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/60286/jagged-alliance-back-in-action-desert-specialist-kit/\">Jagged Alliance: Back in Action - Desert Specialist Kit - Minor DLC</a> (February, 2012).\n- <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/60285/jagged-alliance-back-in-action-jungle-specialist-kit/\">Jagged Alliance: Back in Action - Jungle Specialist Kit - Minor DLC</a> (February, 2012).\n- <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/60086/jagged-alliance-back-in-action-night-specialist-kit/\">Jagged Alliance: Back in Action - Night Specialist Kit - Minor DLC</a> (February, 2012).\n- <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/60088/jagged-alliance-back-in-action-shades-of-red/\">Jagged Alliance: Back in Action - Shades of Red - Expansion DLC</a> (May, 2012).\n- <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/60089/jagged-alliance-back-in-action-point-blank/\">Jagged Alliance: Back in Action - Point Blank - Expansion DLC</a> (June, 2012).</p>",

There is a multitude of creature types, from griffins to rocs, golems to pikemen, unicorns to hydras, and four different dragons. Each castle type has six different creatures, from the weak to the strong. There are six castle types, each corresponding to a hero class: Knight, Sorceress, Wizard (Good side), Barbarian, Necromancer, and Warlock (Evil side). There are also six different types of neutral creatures you can recruit in special structures scattered about the maps.</p>\n<p>Compared to <a href=\"/search/?q=Heroes+of+Might+and+Magic\">the first game</a>, this sequel has larger and more interactive combat screens. The spell system is now based on spell points instead of spell memorization.</p>\n<p>The maps themselves range from small two-player maps to huge maps that all six player types could fit in easily. There is a map maker included, and you can multiplay via hot-seat, modem, or IP.</p>",

Zak must stop this, but he can't do it alone. After finding a strange crystal, Zak manages to get the help of the anthropologist Annie and her friends, Melissa and Leslie. The four unlikely heroes must now figure out a way to destroy the dumbifying devices and save the Earth.</p>\n<p><em>Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders</em> is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure similar in gameplay to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/714/maniac-mansion/\">Maniac Mansion</a>. The player chooses verb commands (Open, Pick Up, Give, etc.; there are no Look or Talk commands) to interact with the game world. The game features up to four controllable protagonists; it is possible to switch between them at any time after they have been introduced, and also exchange inventory items if the characters are in the same location. The game can be described as a \"globe-trotting\" adventure, since the heroes are required to travel to different exotic countries and even leave the Earth for a while in order to complete it. Some of the puzzles are optional or can be solved in different ways.</p>\n<p>The FM Towns version has VGA graphics with 256 colors and higher-quality music and sound effects.</p>\n<p>GOG release comes with two versions of the game that install simultaneously. One is FM Towns version with updated graphics, while the other is marked as Floppy version which is the old DOS version of a game.</p>",

Each of the four players are in one of the corners of the screen guarded by a castle. You control a small shield which can be moved around the edge of the castle. To survive you need to use the shield to block a ball which bounces around the screen. If the ball hits your castle, it will take out some of the bricks. If a hole forms in the castle wall and the ball makes it through and hits your warlord, then you are out of the game. The last player left alive wins the battle, and the first player to win five battles wins the game! Several game options are included which allow you to either catch or ricochet the ball when the shield touches it and control the speed of the game.</p>",

Continuing the events from <a href=\"/search/?q=Lara+Croft+Tomb+Raider%3A+Legend\">Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend</a> and <a href=\"/search/?q=Lara+Croft+Tomb+Raider%3A+Anniversary\">Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Anniversary</a>, her search brings her once again to locations around the globe from the cold wastes of the Arctic to the beautiful landscapes of Thailand. This time even the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea is not save from Lara's exploring. At the same time the game continues to explore the idea of monomyth, this time incorporating the influences of the Norse mythology into its narrative.</p>\n<p>The basic gameplay remains the same as in most of the previous iterations of the series with the focus on exploring, solving riddles and dodgy climbing passages instead of instant action and gun fights. For this Lara once again learned a few new moves including jumping between the walls introduced in <a href=\"/search/?q=Prince+Of+Persia%3A+Sands+Of+Time\">Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time</a>.</p>\n<p>To help the players with the riddles, the game not only features a sonar map, showing Lara's immediate surroundings as a 3D grid for better orientation around the levels. Also, if asked, Lara gives general but helpful tips on what to do next.</p>\n<p>The differences from the previous Tomb Raider games developed by <a href=\"/search/?q=Crystal+Dynamics\">Crystal Dynamics</a> include the complete lack of QTE events. Instead the time slows down in critical moments, but the player still retains full control of the Lara's movements. Another change is the more non-linear level design more in vein with the traditional entries of the series.</p>",

In this game, you play as the zombie, fight off the humans, and eat their brains. Stubbs the Zombie is set in a retro-futuristic city of the future and follows Stubbs over the course of one day as he zombifies the entire city.</p>\n<p>Before becoming a zombie Edward 'Stubbs' Stubblefield was a traveling salesman in the 1930s who got himself killed. Flash forward to 1959 where the world's richest man, Andrew Monday, has built his dream city, Punchbowl Pennsylvania, on top of poor Stubbs' grave. Stubbs will have to claw through all of Punchbowl's citizens, including the local police department, crazy militiamen, nerdy scientists, and a deadly barbershop quartet.</p>\n<p>Luckily Stubbs has some help. Every human that he kills comes back as a zombie and joins Stubbs in his quest for brains. Stubbs also learns a series of special body powers. He can use his unholy flatulence to stun enemies, he can throw his pancreas as an exploding zombie grenade, and he can detach his own head and bowl it into enemies. Stubbs' most powerful ability is that he can detach his hand and use it as a scout, climbing up walls and the ceiling, and then use it to take control of enemy humans and their weapons.</p>",

You face the challenge of freeing your family and friends from the captivity of a Romanian Count at his castle. As the game progresses it stands clear that all is not what it seems and violence becomes the only way to save yourself, your family and mankind. The first objective of the game is obvious. You have to locate and rescue each of your family members and friends held captive. As you rescue your family, you'll learn about the Count's real goals. Among the more unique features in the game is the time limit (you'll have to rescue everyone before midnight), and that the environments are randomly generated each time you play the game.</p>",

The cutscenes closely follow the movie, with added scenes and dialogue added to give more to the game. The gameplay is a basic platformer with a bit of strategy involved, using Wall-E to navigate areas and pick things up to use, players must also figure out ways to reach more out of the reach areas due to Wall-E's limited jump capacity. There are also racing stages designed for the robot, EVE, where the player flies through constricted areas, avoiding fall obstacles.</p>\n<p>This version of the game differs from <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/37197/disneypixar-wall-e/\">the version for PS2, PSP and computers</a> and has nine explorable worlds. The PS3 and 360 versions feature a co-op mode using Wall-E and EVE, while the Wii version offers three head-to-head multiplayer modes.</p>",

The clock is ticking!</p>\n<p>Players will use a combination of keyboard keys and mouse for navigation and various actions (including jumping and running). Many different modes of transportation are at Oliver's disposal to help him travel to and throughout the large locales including camels, elephants, or flying carpets, and several unusual cars, trains, steamboats and flying ships.

So she throws Jack into a cell on her spaceship and heads off for stellar jail, when disaster strikes. The problem isn't that first thing Jack does, is escaping his cell. The problem isn't even that second thing Jack does, is dumping the ships hyperdrive out into space. But now, Ysanne is forced to work together with Mr. Trouble. THAT's what she calls disaster.</p>\n<p>Using the familiar, slightly overhauled interface, you set off for another adventure to save the galaxy. You can play the game alternatively as the incorrigible macho Jack or the tough feminist Ysanne. In either role you'll be visiting the same places, but solve entirely different puzzles. For example, on the same planet, Ysanne has to stop an advancing army, whilst Jack tries to steal back the spaceships lost navigational device. On rare occasions, the two even have to engage in teamwork.</p>\n<p>Guilty, like its predecessor, uses rendered flight scenes for the spacecraft landing and taking off. The CD version of the game adds English full speech for the two protagonists and animated cutscenes.</p>",

                "description": "<p>Freed by the decree of Uriel Septim VII, the Emperor of Tamriel, a lone prisoner is transported to the province of Morrowind. It seems that the strange dreams this prisoner has been having lately may have a connection to equally strange events occurring there. The protagonist is given a simple assignment: join the Blades, a secret organization whose goal is to protect the safety of the Emperor. This leads to a discovery of an ancient prophecy and an evil scheme concocted by a powerful deity whom the protagonist alone is able to stop.</p>\n<p>Conceived in the tradition of the <em>Elder Scrolls</em> series, <em>Morrowind</em> is a fantasy role-playing game with a vast world open for exploration. After being released from a prison ship at the shores of the island Vvardenfell, the protagonist may do more or less what he or she wants: follow the main quest and solve the mystery of an ancient prophecy, join any of roughly a dozen guilds and rise in their hierarchy by performing duties, or simply explore the gigantic island with its stylistically diverse cities, hundreds of dungeons and tombs, ancient ruins and mighty fortresses. </p>\n<p><em>Morrowind</em> uses a two-stage skill system. The hero’s primary stats (strength etc.) increase with each level gained, while secondary abilities improve by use – for example, the more often the character jumps, the more proficient he or she becomes in the Acrobatics skill, etc. The action-oriented fights are simple exchanges of strikes or spells, until one combatant dies. The enemy's hit points and condition were not originally shown; however, at the request of customers a health bar was added for enemies as part of the first upgrade patch.</p>\n<p>The protagonist's race and gender, but also his or her reputation influence the reactions of NPCs. If a character’s sympathy for the hero is low (rated on a scale from 1 to 100), he might refuse to answer questions; if it is high, the player will get more detailed information and better bargains in shops. Most quests involving other persons can be solved by persuasion, pick-pocketing, or simply by force.</p>\n<p>The game's NDL 3D game engine is powerful in drawing wide, detailed outdoor landscapes as well as complex indoor environments. Transitions are not fluent; houses and dungeons must be loaded upon entering.</p>",

                "description": "<p>Vito Scaletta is an Italian immigrant in the United States. Born into a poor family from Sicily, he grows up in the city of Empire Bay and soon becomes best friends with Joe Barbaro, who convinces him that crime is just a way to get easy money. After having attempted a robbery, Vito is arrested and offered a choice by the authorities: go to jail or join the army. Choosing the latter, he is drafted and sent to Italy to fight Mussolini and his followers. After being injured and discharged, he returns to Empire Bay and learns that his deceased father owed a large amount of money. Willing to protect his family from debt collectors, Vito contacts Joe, and the two gradually begin to steer their lives towards organized crime, unaware of the price they will have to pay for that.</p>\n<p><em>Mafia II</em> shares the theme and the basic gameplay concept with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7190/mafia/\">Mafia</a>; though it takes place at a later time and follows the life story of a different protagonist, the game's plot has a few connections with that of the predecessor. The game's story begins in the 1940's and extends into the 1950's. The story follows a linear path and is divided into chapters, each telling a separate episode in Vito's life and his trials and tribulations after getting involved with the mafia.</p>\n<p>Like its predecessor, the game combines free-roaming driving with third-person shooting stages, focusing on the latter. Though the player is free to explore the city (driving a car or on foot), most of the driving gameplay is confined to the missions, which involves getting to the destination, stopping to buy items, hijacking different cars, etc. There are noticeably less chases or violent encounters during the driving sections than in the previous game. Police may arrest Vito for speeding or violent behavior; the player has the option to bribe officers in exchange for freedom.</p>\n<p>The third-person shooting mechanics have been overhauled, featuring a cover-based system similar to that of <a href=\"/search/?q=gears+of+war\">Gears of War</a>. Vito's health regenerates over a short period of time and cannot be restored by other means. He can be easily killed when running in the open; therefore, taking cover and periodically shooting is the prevalent tactic. In addition to firearms from the previous game (Colt 1911, tommy gun, pump-action shotgun, etc.), there are World War II-era weapons in the game, such as the MP 40 and M3 submachine guns. Vito is sometimes assisted by Joe or other characters during the shooting stages.</p>\n<p>One portion of the game, which takes place inside of a prison, has melee-focused brawls. Players can explore interiors to find collectibles, more specifically vintage Playboy magazines to unlock the erotic photos within. The PlayStation 3 version of the game includes exclusive access to the DLC, <a href=\"/search/?q=The+Betrayal+of+Jimmy\">The Betrayal of Jimmy</a>. It is available for free only to those who purchase the base game.</p>",

Each player controls a jet airplane which zooms across the screen and may turn into a ground based soldier. These ground soldiers can hurt enemy units, but can not affect bases. To take over bases scattered across the map (and ultimately, the enemy base), players must purchase new units and transport them to certain positions. In this way, the player acts more like a transport and management for different types of units rather than a combat character themselves. If the plane is ever destroyed, it restarts at the player's base location. As previously mentioned, a level is complete when either side's base is lost to the opposing forces.</p>",

The game moves the player automatically, although the player can find hiding places to shoot from a safe angle. The main task is to aim and fire the cop’s weapon so as to take out the bad guys for points. Avoid the innocents, as shooting them costs the player points. The enemies have tougher firepower than in the original and the game can be played solo or with a friend.</p>",

                "description": "<p><em>Crysis</em>, the first game of a planned trilogy, is a first-person shooter set in the year 2020 and the spiritual successor to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/12534/far-cry/\">Far Cry</a>. The player takes on the role of the US soldier Jake Dunn. On a remote Pacific island, a meteor has been excavated and the North Korean army quickly moved in to secure the location. After they capture a team of US archaeologists, the US Army sends in a Delta Force team to investigate and free the scientists. Most of the missions are played alone, but also often with AI squadmates that star in the cutscenes and play a crucial part in the story.</p>\n<p>During the battles with the North Korean soldiers, it becomes apparent that there is an even greater threat. When the meteor opens up a huge alien ship is revealed that starts to xenoform the island by freezing it over. The Americans and North Koreans are forced to join forces when alien machines emerge from the vessel and attack both sides. Now both sides have to stop the xenoforming process together.</p>\n<p><em>Crysis</em> offers a singleplayer campaign as well as an objective based multiplayer for up to 32 players. One of the main innovations of the game is the so called Nanosuit. This high tech combat suit allows the player to increase his armor, strength or speed for short amounts of time. Jake Dunn and his fellow soldiers can get into a cloaking mode, become invisible and recover health when the suit is powered up.</p>\n<p>In the single player campaign, the player will encounter several enemy types. A large part is spent fighting North-Korean soldiers. Aliens are first encountered in a Zero-G environment once the meteorite has been breached. When leaving the meteorite, the actual alien invasion begins and the player then mainly faces small alien scouts and the larger alien hunters.</p>\n<p>During the campaign, there are a number of more or less typical shooter weapons to be gathered, such as machineguns, a shotgun, a missile launcher, a sniper rifle, explosives, various types of grenades and a gauss gun. In the later weapons, there are also some alien weapons which can freeze opponents. Not all weapons can be held at once; they must be swapped for the ones from the bodies of dead soldiers and most of them have a limited amount of ammo. There is also an extensive weapons upgrade feature which is available from the start and allows the player to reconfigure weapon configurations on the fly. Tactical or explosive ammunition can be added, or a flashlight, a laserscope, a silencer, grenades and more. Most of the weapons have multiple firing options, from single bullets to rapid bursts.</p>\n<p>Almost any vehicle can be driven, from jeeps to large vans, regular cars, tanks and patrol boats. Most of these have mounted weapons. Other equipment includes binoculars, nightvision, a radar with targets in the bottom left corner of the screen and a direct voice connection with other squad members.</p>\n<p>Just like Crytek's previous game <em>Far Cry</em>, it comes with a sandbox editor to create new levels. The console versions do not have the expansions and do not support multiplayer.</p>",

In the game's time frame, this is the earliest game, hence the Japanese title <em>Samurai Spirits Zero</em>. It takes place in 1786 from January through the later summer. The game is therefore considered a prequel to the series.</p>\n<p>The overall gameplay was slightly altered. It is a little faster, and the Slash/Bust system has been removed. Each character now has only one version, or the Bust mode is simply replaced by a new character of very similar setup. Combo slashes, sidestepping and fatalities have also vanished. The basic moves have been modeled after the first games in the series. They consist of three types of slashes, a single kick, and various dodge maneuvers similar to <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/4110/samurai-shodown-ii/\">Samurai Shodown II</a>.</p>\n<p>There are 24 characters, a familiar cast with some new faces. Unlike the previous games, it is not possible to kill your opponent.</p>",

The story and main theme remain the same, but the game has its own unique levels and slightly different gameplay mechanics.</p>\n<p>To save his girlfriend Minnie from the wicked witch Mizrabel, Mickey must venture into the Castle of Illusion. Crossing six levels (including a magical forest, a toy land and a candy world), he must collect the gems of the rainbow in order to confront and defeat the witch.</p>\n<p>Each level features unique obstacles, enemies and a final boss. The enemies can be defeated by jumping on top of them. An alternative way is to pick up objects lying around (like rocks in the forest or blue balls in the toy level) and throwing them at the enemies. Mickey's ability to pick up things and carry them around also leads to some sort of puzzle-oriented gameplay. By placing objects in the right spot and jumping off of them, he can get to areas that are otherwise out of reach. In some levels, he also has to collect keys to open doors. A unique type of object is the treasure chest - by jumping on top of one or throwing it, Mickey gets access to its contents, which might include extra lives, a health power-up or coins to collect for points.</p>",

The game also has some mini-game diversions such as playing Quidditch, dunking gnomes in water, and collecting wizard cards.</p>\n<p>Occasionally Harry will find himself in a combat situation. Harry can be equipped with up to three different spells at a time. If the player can make Harry cast a spell with correct timing, the spell will be more powerful than normal.</p>\n<p>The PlayStation 2 version was ported internally by Electronic Arts instead of by Eurocom who developed the other console versions, hence the PS2 version sporting some noticeable differences. but otherwise keeping the majority of the game the same. Some differences include the PS2 version of the game having an overall lower difficulty level plus when Harry is riding a broom he can land it anywhere instead of only in designated landing spots.

                "description": "<p><em>Shadows of the Damned</em> is a third-person shooter starring the Mexican demon hunter Garcia Hotspur. His girlfriend Paula is kidnapped by Fleming, Lord of the Demons, and even though he is initially unable to stop him, he follows him into the underworld to get her back. Garcia is assisted by his sidekick Johnson, a skull that can take on different types of forms. It acts as a torch for melee attacks, but can also transform into a pistol, a shotgun or an automatic rifle. Each of the three gun forms can be further upgraded by collecting blue gems left behind by bosses. There are also red gems that are used to upgrade the other abilities, along with health. Health can also be restored through alcohol.</p>\n<p>Darkness is an important part of the gameplay and the environment puzzles. Garcia can only reside in dark areas for a short time before his health starts to drain. This can be avoided by shooting and lighting goat heads, setting off fireworks or killing the demons that spread the darkness. For these events a special light bullet needs to be used. Garcia meets characters such as Colonel, and the half-human half-demon Christopher who acts as a salesman to purchase goods.</p>\n<p>Certain levels have complete different gameplay and resemble mini-games, such as a 2D side-scrolling shooter with very different art design for instance. The action is often over the top and the conversations carry a humorous tone.</p>",

Failure to pass the buoys, on the other hand, leads to decrease in speed and eventually disqualification.</p>\n<p>Game modes include Warm Up (basically a training session in a course known as Dolphin Park); Time Trials, in which players race against time; Championship, in which players compete in a tournament, choosing one of the four available difficulty levels; and Stunt Mode, where performing various stunts awards players with point. A two-player split-screen versus mode is available as well. Players can customize their racers, modifying their parameters, which include grip, handling, acceleration, top speed and collision stability.</p>",

Like its predecessors, the interface still consists mainly of text, menus and clickable boxes, which are all navigated using the mouse.</p>\n<p>Though CM4 is visually very similar to its predecessors, it does offer a few new additions as well as some enhancements to the series. The most notable of these additions is the 2D pitch viewpoint, which is only available during matches. Basically, it replaces the classic commentaries with a top-down view of the match, where you can watch your players live up to your selected tactics (or watch them stuff up in style). Other additions and enhancements include a totally skinable interface, a revamped tactics engine and an enhanced contract negotiating system.</p>\n<p>As for the actual gameplay, little has changed since the previous installment. Being the manager still means you're in charge of almost every aspect of your selected club, from hiring staff to setting up team tactics and so forth. And you still have to live up to that pesky club board's expectations.</p>",
